I know the location of the Best Circle K on the planet!!!!

It's right here...really...right friggin' here!

It's one of those situations where the stars all aligned and everything turned out perfectly...we don't know why and we don't want to question divine providence...we just want it to continue to be great!

Over the years, I've seen my share of Circle K's, 7-11's, AM/PM's and their locally owned brethren...most of them smell and look like an overheated  dorm room after a drunken 12 person orgy (don't ask me how I know this...I would have to tell you and you just can't ""unhear"" some things).

And while I (much like you) need to occasionally use one of these markets (""what!...I thought you were bringing ice""...""we're out of butter on Thanksgiving?""...""oh well...off I go!""), I have tried to keep those foray's short and when I do have to drop in, I usually wear latex gloves so I don't actually have to come into contact with any surfaces in these places.  

However, this particular Circle K is so very clean (I guess to keep the resort trade from the Valley Ho and the squatters living in the remains of the now defunct Ramada Inn across the street, happy), and so very well stocked and run, that it will alter your understanding of what the phrase ""convenience store"" is really supposed to mean!

To wit:

* Want Costco like special prices on a large selection of some really terrific wines and specialty beers? This Circle K has 'em!

* You need a quick refill on either infant or adult diapers?...Drop by for a ""reload"".

* Want a decent cup of coffee on the go? Circle K fills the bill (no, it's not as good as Sola's coffee, but geez, it's  1/2 the price of those places and for the price, it's really a decent cup of coffee)

* How about a hot, dog, polish, one of those rolled burrito dealies or a slurpee?...you can get any of those and much more in a non-sticky, non-smelly, clean and friendly environment!

* Need Handy Wipes for the ""homeless shower"" since there isn't water and electricity at the Ramada...done and done!

I want to emphasize...this is the best Circle K on earth...right here in the friendly confines of Old Town Scottsdale (and Old Town Scottsdale really is friendly...why just this morning, I found a used condom on the street while I was out walking Deedee...what could be friendlier than that!?!?)

The employees here are all pleasant and helpful, the shelves are clean, organized and well stocked, the drink and food areas are scrupulously clean...you get a choice of crushed or cubed ice...and you'll always get a smile and gracious ""thanks"" from the clerks (even when I use my credit card for an $0.86 drink!)

So, for three plus years of consistently great service, clean surroundings and for being there when I needed them, a solid 5 stars as the very best of the convenience store breed!",review,De5urGVv1kkiKVJ9bvlQ6w

well, i just got back from a labor day weekend vacation to vegas. I had always wanted to try hookah in vegas, and finally this was my chance! This place is perfect! It's hookah + fine teas! Oh my there were indeed fine!

My friend and I arrived around 10PMish and was immediately greeted and seated by a cute young lady. I had ordered the dreamy rose tea and we tried their hookah flavor FRUIT LOOPS. They are very well known for this flavor because it's their own family recipe! It really did taste like fruit loops, but after a while it tasted more like just a fruit mix thing. Still good.

The other flavor we got was rosarita AKA rose+margarita mix. SOOOOOOOOOOOOO fuckin awesome! Whoever thought of this mix must be part genius part hookah god. It was delicious and smooth. 

I just how their decor, I love how they fill their glass base of the hookah with tons of ice. It makes the smoking experience much cooler and smoother. I just love the black light, the candles, the cool LED lights that are attached to the tables so when you put a hookah over the light, the hookah will glow colors!

On to the customer service. I almost felt bad that they were treating us so well. Charcoal service was ALWAYS tip top and LITERALLY when the smoke got kinda harsh toward the end, the guy immediately came up and asked me if it was getting harsh because he heard me cough just ONCE.

Anyways, this place is WONDERFUL because it's really nice to get away from the strip because I anticipate that the hookah bars there are probably filled with drunk whores with short ass skirts while guys touch them inappropriately while sucking on hookahs that are incompetent compared to Azuza's hookahs.

best hookah bar i've ever been to. no lies!",review,3KAfAz5xzjop5RmyYLW4Sg

So we decided to go to Pan Asian tonite.  The last time we were there it was ok, not bad. I enjoyed the atmosphere, so coming back was i thought going to be good again.  Well i ordered the mango shrimp salad, and when the waitress asked us how spicy, my husband and i knew better to ask what scale they used (we eat out a lot, especially thai!) whether it was 1-5 or 1-10?  when she said 1-10, we ordered it a 2! well when i recieved it, it was so spicy that i could no longer eat the rest of the food we ordered....i was disappointed but not mad.  i felt that maybe they did a mistake.  So i didnt make a fuss, but i did tell the waitress i was dying and needed water.  The waitress told the owner that it was too hot for me, so he said he would fix it,  But it was too late my mouth was on fire.  But this whole time, mind you i WAS NOT MAD, until the owner started to say stuff like it shouldnt be too spicy and that he didnt see anything wrong with the salad even though it was encrusted in red pepper,  and that i ate most of the shrimps so it must not be that bad!!  (it came with 3 fricken shrimps!!!) i started to feel offended by his remarks but still paid for dinner.  my point was not to not pay for our food.  i was ok until he started to talk.  Then he said next time to not order a salad with a 2! thats real spicy.  WHAT?????  then whats a 5 on his scale.

Although I feel like I will still call this place ""Fo Vietnam"" rather than ""Fuh Vietnam"" as whenever I have called it ""Fuh"" most people give me strange looks and I feel like a bit of a pretentious food-snob.

Anyway, now we've cleared that up, it's actually not very relevant as I didn't end up trying the Pho. Instead, squeezed into this pint-sized wee restaurant, with a modest menu to match, I settled on the fried Vietnamese noodles with seafood.

When it arrived I thought there was no way I would finish it. A pretty hefty portion, packed FULL of prawns and squid (although small prawns, rather than the big King ones. I suppose I just expect those nowadays but it shouldn't have disappointed me). Maybe slightly less veg than I'd hoped for, as that was the main reason I chose the noodles over the pho. But ohhhh. Those big thick noodles were, despite being fried, so light. Fried in egg, it looks like, but not greasy or heavy at all.

Flash-forward 10 minutes and they're all gone and I could easily have asked for seconds. So for a big bowl of steaming, egg fried noodles with ample prawns and squid, this is perfect. Chop sticks too, winning. All the food I saw come out also looked very tempting, especially the cold (not fried) spring rolls (bonus points for healthiness).

Throw into the mix a super, SUPER friendly waitress but in a genuine, rather than eager-to-please, way it made for an all-round delightful evening out.

Like I said, it is small. Really small. Chairs need to be shuffled around when people arrive to get past, and when the restaurant was full (which I believe it is most nights) it was loud and anyone with personal space issues might have a wee freak out.

For that reason, book in advance. It was a Tuesday night and folk were getting turned away at the door as it was booked up.

Next time I WILL try the Pho. Unless those noodles get the better of me again. But for hearty, but quite healthy, comfort food in the shape of rice noodles and broth, it's a winner.",review,5qY6LqQFupz2Dm8LB4xkJw

I looked at the menu, and my heart skipped a beat or two. Yes, please! 

Yet the promise of a mouthwatering French/Cajun meal, was disappointing--especially for a meal for two that totaled nearly $200 without alcohol. My starter, a king crab/shrimp cocktail was standard to say the least. Two prawns and a tiny piece of king crab. Really? The soup course consisted of a vegetable lobster soup. I was expecting any bisque (my mistake), but it was a tomato based seafood broth that actually lacked any real meat. I'm not one to shy away from the salt, but it ""tasted like the ocean,"" as a fellow dinner commented. I actually think my tongue was numb after eating half the bowl (couldn't take any more than that). My entree was a bouillabaisse which I truly believe used the SAME exact broth as my soup course. Some of the shellfish were nicely done, but overall the fish was overcooked, and so ""fishy"" that I couldn't finish the plate. As a dessert, I chose the fruit and nut roll, which was a combination of baklava and an egg roll. Eh, for a french restaurant they could have upped the game. 

While overall I felt the food was uninspired, and I truly made some ordering errors, the greatest crime of the night was the service. The waiter was visibly annoyed when I failed to order a glass of water after pursuing the wine menu--sorry, but nothing struck my fancy.  I asked for recommendations for a combination of choices that would ""flow"" nicely. His response? ""Just order whatever sounds good. I don't know what would work well together.""  After I received my soup course I realized that it was JUST LIKE a bouillabaisse broth and quickly requested to change my entree. Nope--already cooking. I'm sorry, but that's unacceptable. He NEVER once returned to check on our entree or dessert course. 

In fact, we didn't see him again until the bill came--which was a complete disaster. Six couples attended the dinner. After finishing the meal, the server returned to drop the bill. Apparently they don't split checks. I understand the added challenge of splitting a check, but if that's your standard policy write it clearly on the menu, or let us know before the meal is served. When we brought this issue to the server's attention, he commented, ""Well you should have asked."" I'm sorry my friend, you should have told us. The manager provided little more assistance. Eventually, it was agreed that we would all mark our orders on the bill so they would know how much to charge each credit card. Forty five minutes later we were on our way. I guess good service isn't required when they automatically add an 18% gratuity. I'm not cheap tipper, but I do expect some level of service. Razz's failed on every occasion. 

In all fairness, some of my dining companions did have memorable meals. The lamb was succulent, the escargot had a creaminess that is the hallmark of perfect cooking, and the lobster crab cake in a pear/curry sauce took the award for best and most innovative dish of the night. 

While there were some culinary high notes, I can assure you that I will not be returning to Razz's anytime soon.",review,7lp13T_FUmX1XjU2wen_qw

I mention the time because you would expect a restaurant that is open until 11 to be prepared for business. It was dark inside, with the booths and laminated panel walls leftover from the 70's. There were flies buzzing around EVERYwhere, and it was as hot inside as it was outside (the thermostat read 86 degrees). With all those warning signs, we should have turned around and left. Unfortunately, we didn't.

We opted for the buffet, and then found out that there was hardly anything left to choose from. Many warming trays were either empty, or had only 1 or 2 items left. One warming tray held only 4 teeny tiny shrimp wrapped in bacon. The 5 or 6 remaining pork ""strips"", which were about the size of skinny McDonald's French fries, looked like they had sat burning in the tray all day and had sweet sauce poured over them to keep them hydrated. The cheese covered mussels were so dried out that the cheese was like cement and mussels were like rubber bands. The hot and sour soup tasted as if the broth was made from green tea instead of chicken stock, and for all the ingredients floating around, it was surprisingly tasteless, neither hot (spices) or sour. The salmon looked as if it was floating in oily dishwater. On the positive side,  My husband said his rangoons were good., and I thought the chow mein noodles were tasty. The waiter was very nice, so that's why I rated this 1 star instead of 0.

Our bill came to $20 for the 2 of us, which was high seeing we were dripping sweat, chasing flies from our plates throughout the meal, there wasn't much food to choose from, (whatever remained looked as if it had been sitting there since 11am). Great Wall is the only Chinese restaurant in town, but if I getting a craving for Chinese food again, I'll drive to Chandler or Tempe instead, and I recommend you do the same.",review,-mLcpJYfX8tw8LR9bq018w

They don't do gun smithing, but they were adamant on recommending Wild West. I called them up and spoke with Shannon who was extremely helpful and decided to go the next day (today). On my way home from work however, I happened to stop at Guns (Peacemakers Gun Shop) off Decatur who didn't want to take on the job, but also highly recommended Wild West. At this point, I take my ass home, grab my gear, and head down to Wild West.

I got there and met the crew and they were cool enough to show me the back where the work gets done and even the proper way to remove a pinned and welded flash hider. Also, at my request, removed my front sight post and gas tube. Not only do they have an impressive store front and workshop, but they were all really awesome guys and absolutely set the standard for professionalism and great work.

I thanked them and went to the front to square up the bill and they said that it didn't take that long and insisted on calling it even. I can tell you guys that I was sincerely shocked. It's companies like Wild West that make me want to pay favors forward. I would, just like the experienced industry long timers that did me, HIGHLY recommend Wild West to anyone looking to do business with an experienced staffed gun smithing company (that do anything and everything). They've earned my business most certainly and a lot of respect to go along with it.

Thanks a bunch, guys! See you soon.

Booked reservations for Valentine's Day online by way of Booking.com and arrived 1/2 an hour early in full realization that check in was at 4pm. We'd honestly just planned on grabbing drinks from Addiction while we waited. Went on to notice that valet has since been discontinued.

#BUMMER

Went to check in and despite my/our reservation being somewhat easily located, the staff seemed to have been ""jet lagged"" if not ""hung over"". A line of 5-6 potential guest(s) accrued behind us and the front desk staff seemed completely oblivious to it all as they continued to take their sweet azz time never so much as even acknowledging anyone waiting behind us; one gal' even had to calculate the change back multiple times when given a penny extra per our furnishing $200.01 for a bill equating $160.01. (....sighs)....Are you really so damn remedial that you're unable to configure $40 to be adequate change??? Did the penny throw you off? No.... Really???

All in all, they all needed to GET THEIR PHUKKIN' LIVES. This was absolutely abysmal. Whereas this used to be the ONLY place that I'd stay, I've since amended my thoughts. Wana' know why? Keep on reading......it gets far worse!

My partner had a business Visa card complete w/ the logo at the bottom of it only for us to be informed by staff that Rumor could NOT honor this card and that we were in need of a bank card of some sort. We're from California and this is clearly some Nevada b/s. SMFH. Having nothing but cash on us (it's Vega$ after all) and not knowing the location of banks, etc., we opted to load a prepaid card from CVS not too far away and were told that the hotel didn't take this method of payment as well. Uhm....okay? Really?! Last time I checked it was '2014.

We were then informed by the manager (or so she professed herself to be) upon her gracing our presence, that to leave a cash deposit we would be required to drop off $300 cash as opposed to $50 using a card that qualified.

Uhm... WTF??? Are we staying overnight or moving the phuk' in??? This compelled us to contact my sister to partition her services - - - THANKFULLY SHE'S A LOCAL.

She consented to having her bank card charged the required $50 and we were thereon compelled to forge through The Strip traffic at rush hour on Valentine's Day - Friday......across town...... to pick her up only to turn around and take the same trip back just to prevent our room reservations from being cancelled at 6pm.

We get back to find that there was NOOO availability (apparently our room was given away) only to request to speak w/  this same less than helpful manager. Evidently this was a 2 person process as both ""stoned"" front desk employees left the front counter unattended to fetch this woman, .....in turn, compromising ALL OF THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF THEIR GUEST(S) by leaving vital information exposed upon the counter w/o so much as batting an eye. This chick finally reappeared and points us in the direction of our room only to inform us both that apparently she neglected to leave adequate documentation to pinpoint that we'd be returning to claim our room. SMFH. 

Thereon we went to said suite only to walk in and realize that it was THE INCORRECT ROOM!!! Upon exiting, my sister (seeing as how she accompanied us) decided to check out the decor' in the bathroom whereas she and my partner walked in (and I couldn't make this up if I tried) only to find SHIT (yes feces) on the floor and door.

#GUH'ROSSSS!!!

Now I do realize this to be a pet friendly location but this was absolutely disgusting and compels you to question what's lurking behind your sheets prior to resting your head for a good night's sleep. We couldn't even make out if it was Fido's turd-ling or an actual human being's!

It should go w/o stating that we were led to abort and request a NEW ROOM. After being given a new key card we all left for dinner.

Returned 2 hours later w/ much accrued reluctancy....to a nicer room yet we were never apologized to for any of the above. We were even lied to and informed that the fecal matter on the floor was make-up of some sort? Question: Who in the hell applies make-up while laying down on bathroom tile??? I'm just saying.... 

My hypothesis is that this type of HazMat (Hazardous Material) fiasco transpires on a routine basis yet MOST people neglect to so much as acknowledge it further allowing the hotel to continue skimping by on a wing and a prayer. They agreed to comp' a room within the future and we both refused emphatically. 

I ""used to be"" a regular here staying at least once every few months, however I can't see myself returning. Why you ask?... because I CALL BULLSHIT!!!

From the outside looks of the Edinburgh Larder, it seemed like a quaint and authentic place to eat, so we decided to give it a try for late lunch/early dinner. As soon as we walked inside, each of the employees not only greeted us with a huge smile but seemed genuinely interested in where we were traveling from, giving us advice on where to visit during our time in Edinburgh. They were the epitome of hospitable and friendly to us and all the other customers, so the service was phenomenal. Nay, it was incomparable, and really set the bar high for the rest of our UK interactions. 

Now, as for the food, my friend and I went straight for their cheese plates with pumpkin chutney and oatcakes. The Thistly Cross cider was also highly recommended, so we turned this late lunch/early dinner into an all-out feast. The food is sourced from all over Scotland, and I can't speak highly enough about the quality. The staff is so knowledgeable about what they're serving and how they're preparing it that, well, I wish I could eat there every day (which my friend and I did while we were in Edinburgh). Also, Thistly Cross is pretty much the most dangerously delicious adult beverage I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying, so I need to figure out where I can get my hands on it in the States. 

We ended up eating there twice more during our stay, and both of those times were for breakfast. It doesn't get any better than being greeted first thing in the morning by the friendliest people in Scotland. Plus, the clotted cream and jam is always the way to go! I can't thank the Edinburgh Larder and its staff for such a memorable and enjoyable first (but definitely not last) trip to Edinburgh. 

Side note to prove that the employees there are the best, love their job, and you should go there immediately if you're in Edinburgh: My friend and I were visiting in early March and the entire cafe was filled with fresh-picked daffodils.

I was right in the center of the madness, with views of nearly all the kitchen stations, and I enjoyed watching the controlled chaos of such an esteemed kitchen. I indulged in the 9-course tasting menu ($135), and it was absolutely phenomenal. Personal highlights included butter-poached oysters, pumpkin soup with chestnuts and homemade croutons, free-range quail stuffed with foie gras and glazed with acacia honey (served with truffled mashed potatoes that included three huge slices of the exotic mushroom), and papaya puree with banana ice cream. Service from my individual waiter was somewhat lackluster (he seemed disappointed that I wanted tap water and only ordered one glass of wine--which, consequently, was $22), but the ""supporting cast"" of servers assistants did a great job of enhancing my experience.

Service is good. Constantly checked on us, were friendly, and were great on refilling our drinks.
The weird thing is that the food isn't too spicy. You can pick from a scale of 1-10 for the spice of your food, and I was surprised to find that I could handle a 7 (I'm a weak sauce when it comes to spicy food! A few Hot Cheetos and I'm drinking a gallon of milk).

But it was the only thing open at that hour across the expressway from my hotel so I didn't listen to my intuition, which was a good thing because it turned out to be great.

Dan ordered this monstrosity-sounding thing that was like a steak quesadilla stuffed with french fries.  It came with the most nuanced salsa ever.  I mean, I could taste every little spice that went into that bowl separately in my mouth, and every one of them tasted fresh.  In addition to that, the quesadilla wasn't too greasy, the steak was not overcooked, and the french fries were somehow, despite being mashed into a quesadilla and fried, not mealy.  Yum!

My hot garlic chicken wings, despite being placed roughly in the middle of the spice indicator on the menu, were so hot that when I brought them to my face I started coughing before they made it to my mouth.  However, when they actually did make it to my mouth, it was a slow-burning spice, one easily extinguished by the bleu cheese dressing.  Which was bland and slightly chemically on its own, but served its raita-like purpose nicely.

We politely asked for a few minutes, and the guy proceeded to just stand there. Staring at us. Waiting. Not looking away. I explained that this was our first time and we need a minute to think about what we need in hopes that he would at least smile and tell us to take our time. Nothing. Just stood there and stared us down until we ordered*. No pressure.

The second staff cheerfully brought us our meal with a pleasant smile and really warmed the place up. This guy seemed to be the grill man, and I'm not sure why they don't put him at the cash register. 

My food: Regular burger with no cheese was room temperature and needed a little salt for my taste as the inside was completely unseasoned and unsalted, only the tops are sprinkled with grill seasoning it seems. Fell apart trying to hold the weight of so much mayo. Sweet potato fries were also lukewarm but delicious and mushy. 

His food: Garlic Mushroom Swiss burger was passable but like other Yelpers said, these mushrooms are waterlogged and canned, never having seen a grill in their miserable lives. Chili cheese fries were the star of the show, piled high with steak chili and liquid molten nacho lava goodness. Hot and fresh, seasoned well. 

Notes:

-They DO deliver from 11am to 2pm. Call first!

-There is outdoor seating (2 tables), should you want to sit and eat while being serenaded by the sounds and smells of Central Ave traffic. 

-The inside seating is tiny, and while the atmosphere screams family, you will not be comfortable eating here unless you're a party of two. Their take-out service might serve you better.

-If you're going for the first time, I suggest either the Mexican Burger or anything buried in chili and cheese. Can't go wrong, and wash it down with sweet tea if you're so inclined.

We've been wanting to try this place out for some time since we live very close and heard good things from several different people. We are both glad we finally decided to go.

The menu is very diverse with many pork, chicken, beef, seafood and rice and noodle options.

We decided to order pork fried rice, beef with snow peas and moo shoo chicken along with the complimentary tea and white rice. All dishes were fresh, hot and served to us within 10 minutes of our order. We had plenty of food left over and gave me another meal today.

The pork fried rice was a little bit different from what I've grown up eating in California, but still good nonetheless. The rice was darker and had bean sprouts. The moo shoo also came pre-wrapped. Other places I've eaten ate you always filled your own pancake. Either way, I still have the food inside spill out.

The main dining room isn't especially big, but has several booths and table to sit at. 

There is a small bar inside if you wish to have a drink during dinner.

There are daily lunch specials for under $7. I'm going to head back this week or next week to enjoy one of the lunch specials.",review,Kp7FuOK-vb1ufpCsTU14eQ

Now that's my kind of breakfast.
 
Lolo's Chicken and Waffles is a small joint located in a not so lovely residential area of Phoenix . Don't let the surrounding area fool you though, inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats. The inside of Lolo's has a very homey look and feel. Their menu is full of different Soul food fare. The coolest thing about Lolo's is that their entire menu is offered all day. If you want breakfast for dinner, you can. If you want dinner for breakfast, go for it. It's awesome!
 
My fiancé and I both ordered their KK's breakfast, which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken, two waffles (we both added pecans to our waffles), cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, Yams, sausage patties and a slice of red velvet cake. My father ordered their fired chicken omelet, which was made with fried chicken, bell peppers, onions and cheese. Everything that we ate that morning was excellent. The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful, especially the dark meat. The waffles were light and fluffy and packed full of pecans. The yams were really sweet and had a nice cinnamony flavor. Their sausage patties, which they make in house, were some of the best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese was really cheesy and gooey. The grits were also really cheesy and also really buttery. My dad's omelet was delicious. They made his omelet with four eggs and loaded it with juicy fried chicken (skin and all) and lots of grilled veggies. They also topped it with a ton of shredded cheese. The red velvet cake, which we took to go, was really moist. The cream cheese frosting, which was covered with pecans, was not overly sweet and was really creamy. To wash down all this yummy grub I had a huge glass of super sweet cherry Kool-Aid. My fiancé and dad both had their sweet tea, which was just as sweet as their Kool-Aid.
 
The service here was great. Our waitress was really funny and friendly. She was shocked to see us order so much food, especially at 10am. She joked around with us the whole time and always kept my mason jar of Kool-Aid filled to the brim. The prices here were great too.

This is really a wonderful place for anyone who feels awkward in any way about working out. The teachers are really nice and friendly, and the range of women attending classes is great. All ages, all sizes, introverts and extroverts. I'm not the best at coordination and i screw up the dance moves all the time, but i feel ok doing that. The teachers will try to help me; the other ladies will screw up too. There is such a positive energy there, no one is really judging. As proof of this- I happened to be in a class where an older lady had a bit of a gas attack. Everyone just ignored it. Work at your own pace, they really encourage it. The teachers are really great about answering questions or offering alternatives if something is too hard for where you are at personally in your fitness, or if you have an injury to work around. 

The prices are a little bit higher or else I would go there non-stop. But I definitely think that it's worth saving up to go. The location can be tricky to find at first as it is kinda at the back of a shopping complex, but after you know where it is at, it's nice that you are a bit hidden when you are super sweaty. Since it has set class times, you are usually leaving with a group of ladies, so i've never felt there was an issue with safety. They do have a fee if you miss a class without canceling, but they are super nice and will waive it if you just explain it. 

The classes range from sweaty workout to fun dance, so i recommend doing an unlimited pass if possible and sampling a range to find what you like. I personally love burn by candlelight as a soothing pace, but great workout. 

The main thing I love about this place is the energy and positive attitude.",review,iSX42cfFLGpyQHpzb4xPNg

The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.

As always, love the fresh baguette. For dinner they also give a nice little apple, radish, vinegar salad that was really good. The mussels were just ok. Also, one of them was still closed, which you're not supposed to eat. Honestly, from such a nice restaurant, they're supposed to check in the kitchen and throw it out. This makes me wonder what else they may have missed... 

The Brussels sprouts with bacon were really good. When they say bacon, they mean chunks of pork belly. It was AWESOME. The spinach was overcooked and boring. Again, I expect more from this place. I guess I should stick to the main dishes, but I don't eat very much and avoid large slabs of meat. I heard the waiter say they are known for their steak that is just cooked in butter. Maybe next time. 

Oh yes, and dessert was the baked apple tartine. It would have been one the most awesome deserts ever had it not been sitting in a pool of syrup sauce. It soaked into everything, and it was like injecting my veins with pure sugar. I would try to order the sauce on the side, then it would be perfect.  

Otherwise I think I'll stick to brunch. My last review from brunch:

Brunch on Saturday. Ordered a mimosa and french toast. The french toast was served with house made blueberry syrup, with fresh blueberries on the side. Wasn't too sweet, until I got too full.

Other than the fake lumpia, this place was fun. Nothing classy about it ... but not too trashy. My friends who are Vegas locals however did warn us that one of their friends got shanked like 50 times ... so .... that kind of put us on some type of alert. We didn't stay too long.

The interior is ok, I hope they upgrade the exhaust system since it smelled a little like a stinky-fried-food Chinese restaurant.  The first server we had was terrible, but it turns out it was his first day.  All the other servers are super knowledgeable and awesome. 

The prices are super reasonable for the quality of food.  The Chef used to be the Executive Chef of Social House on the strip so he knows all the vendors and gets top notch ingredients.  The hubby is super sensitive to uni and if it's just a smidge not fresh he will pick up on it and claim it to be ""fishy"" or ""too slimy"".  He RAVED about the uni here and even ordered himself seconds!  Trust, this has never happened before (not even at Raku or Kabuto or Yonaka).  The chef is dedicated to making sure his food is extremely fresh and clean tasting. 

We tried the yellowtail, the tostadas, beef tataki, angus gyoza, butter lettuce cod, and crispy rice tuna roll.  All were amazing, especially the yellowtail, tuna poke tostada, and cod (as well as some other nigiri and sashimi we had).  I would pass on the gyoza and crispy rice.  Gyoza was limp (and I guess I still prefer traditional pork) and a tad too greasy.  Crispy rice roll is a great concept, just didn't care for the actual crispy rice.  It was kind of stale and not crisp.  

Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu - they also have HH.  The toastadas are only $1 each.  I might just have to go and get like 10 of the ahi poke toastadas.",review,OwBPjUz2o0J5K3DzcHkBtg

I had the peppered steak. It was not frozen and was made to order. The flavor profile was a little off for me but I should have known that when I ordered, the peppered steak comes with melted Stilton and the Stilton was just a little bit overpowering and too earthy for me. Although I love blue cheese I would have probably been better suited with the cheese steak.  However, other than that the pasty was great! perfectly cooked and the bread was cooked on the outside with hot filling on the inside - think a deluxe hot pocket. 

My only complaints were that the waitress was nice but a little dense and incredibly slow. She didn't bring the happy hour cider I requested and brought a larger size at a larger price - but larger cider really shouldn't be a point of contention I suppose. Also, for the $9ish I would have liked to see the pasty come with a side, fries or something else. 
 
We also bought the garlic fries. They didn't taste fried but more like the oven fries I make at home (my attempt to bake fries to be healthy which hopefully offsets the copious amounts of french fries from fast food places I eat). The problem with what appeared to be baked or crisped fries was that the garlic on the outside was burnt. Maybe they should put the garlic on after they cook the fries to avoid this problem. 

Two pastys, four beers and fries came to about $44. Steep for lunch but I suppose not bad considering the four beers. They also have a decent english/irish beers on tap and many more in bottles. 

Suprisingly for a  pub in the commercial center, they were not smoky and they had a child seat, which means children are welcome! They had a few larger booths so groups of 4 or more could come here as well.

When I went, the ""main"" reception area, before you go further into the spa and enter the ""sub"" reception areas, was like grand central station - I do not exaggerate. In fact the whole place was pretty much that way, although they do have a lot of people working there and they keep things moving smoothly. 

I had just flown in very early that morning and I was ready for a several hour spa visit, starting with soaking and sauna and segue-ing into a 90 minute facial and brow wax. 

The locker rooms are busy but clean, the robes nice and fluffy and the soft rubbery thongs felt good on the feet. The decor and atmosphere in the saunas and jacuzzis is brightly lit, stark white tile with a little blue here and there, feeling and looking more like a sports club or community center than a spa. Service is excellent and there's plenty of fresh cold water and fluffy towels.

The waiting area for the facial was slightly more relaxing, dimly lit with comfortable seating areas where you could relax and rest your body. However, the staff were gathered around the front desk gossiping and I found this super annoying (remember it was my first day and I hadn't relaxed yet). I just could not block them out. My aesthetician was great and I found a polite way to ask her if they had a break room, and she said they did but that it was very far away. 

This is the classic error made by most modern hotels. They don't provide adequate facilities for their staff, so the service and guests ultimately suffer. I've seen this problem in the best hotels and it never ceases to befuddle me.This wouldn't prevent me from going back to Canyon Ranch. The services are really excellent.

SITREP

I did NOT want to be here.  I kept wondering, ""Where is Mr. Rogers?  This is NOT my neighborhood!!!""

THE SETUP

I was on a Spokane to Sacramento trip...BY WAY OF FUC'n PHOENIX!  ""Way to add 5 hours to a 2 hour flight, SouthWest!""  But it's kinda hard to blame the lovely Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport that turn of events.

[And in the end, it was even hard to get angry at SouthWest since they DID have the courtesy to take us right smack over the top of the Grand Canyon - a sight I'd never seen before - so THAT in itself was an ironic treat.  ""Hey Mom!  Yeah, I know I was going to Sacramento, BUT guess what?  I saw the Grand Canyon too!""  Now THAT doesn't happen every day.]

AIRPORT METRICS

Sky Harbor is such a beautiful, large airport, with lots of different terminals, lots of different automatic walkways, and - get this - LOTS of Laptop Bar & Stool set-ups.  During my 2 1/2 hour layover, where I also switched planes, I got to charge my laptop, my camera, my iPhone, and my external battery charger:  I was set!

WIFI

Free!  That's all I need to say!  I was able to connect quickly and upload all of those pictures I had just taken of the grand canyon to Flickr, Yelp and Facebook.  I also did some blogging to boot.

IN SUM

I have no idea what the traffic was like to get to the airport... since I landed there.

I have no idea what the parking situation was like at the airport... since I landed there.

I have no idea what the TSA Checkpoint situation is like at this airport since....yeah, you guessed it, I LANDED there.

But you know what?  As a guest of the airport who galavorted from one terminal to another terminal as a transfer to catch my next flight, it was not a bad deal.

Hubby surprised me with a night out- He heard from a little birdy (gf Heather) that I wanted to try Orange Sky. This experience is probably slightly biased in that I was completely smitten from being surprised with a nice dinner at a beautiful place... but here goes :)

The valet area at Talking Stick is nicely lit and busy, good energy there. When you go to the elevator lobby for the OS, there is a receptionist that checks your reservation before you go up to the 15th floor in a glass elevator- oh, the view. Just amazing. Its the kind of elevator that makes you want to hit the emergency button and make out, except that now I'm old enough to think 1) elevators are probably really germy places 2) there's probably a camera in that elevator (not my thing so much, but I'm not judging), and 3) what if there was a real emergency? what kind of jerk would I be? ok, I digress.

After checking in with the hostess we got drinks at the bar. Yes, I know, people complain about the drinks being too expensive, they're $10-$15. But the price is comparable to any other high end restaurant in the valley, and they're all alcohol. I'd rather pay top dollar for a stiff drink than have 3 watered down drinks. The Sunset Martini was soooo good. 

We were shown to our table, a big booth facing the fireplace, perfect for a romantic dinner. The service was fantastic, really- its what Mastro's was back in the day. I had the artichoke bisque (a special for Restaurant Week but I didn't want the rest of the menu, so they accommodated me and let me get it anyway)- it was very tasty (the pancetta didn't hurt). Hubby had a beet salad that he enjoyed, and got the scallops which were cooked perfectly. I had the shrimp/scallop steaks wrapped in jalapeno bacon and they were as good as they sound. We also got the smoked cheddar whipped potatoes (this was the only so-so part of the meal, they were on the bland side) and the mushroom risotto which was really good. Risotto is one of those things thats either cooked right or not, and it was done really well. 

I can't wait to go back, it was really enjoyable.",review,6qCDfZ0VAX9-O6X5ZFpXrQ

I gotta give 'em 5, partially for an apology (we eat there about twice a month) and partially because it's the only sushi bar I've been to in Vegas that's any fun -- Mostly, though, it's really quite good. We generally get there a bit early (some, but not all sushi is half-price) and the bar isn't crowded so it gives to time to have a bit of fun with the chefs, who do a great job.

We've eaten in the restaurant itself a few times which is also good, just not preference, nor is the tepenyaki (sp?) area -- I'm not crazy about sitting around a hot grill with folks I don't know. But the food in that area is good as well.

It's reasonable also -- I don't think we've ever paid more than $50 for two (mostly for me) at the sushi bar...and that includes a drink, usually scotch, for me as well. And, they don't, like so many places in Vegas, ""pour light.""

Of course it was my first trip, but this was one of the cheaper options and seemed like a good value.  As a Vegas virgin, I was impressed with the decor and liked the theme and details such as hieroglyphics in the elevators. Casino was spacious, not as smokey as some, and had several convenient bars/lounges integrated with the floor, if you just want to chill and not gamble.

LAX: crowded, but fun if you like crowded nightclubs and don't mind smoke and not sitting down. Good mix of music, hot crowd.  Put your name on the list as a hotel guest and get in for free. Our wait was about 30 mins. around 11:30.

Liquidity, Flight, Aurora: similar lounges/bars in casino, good places to chill with friends while taking a gambling break, or for video gambling at a bar.

Pyramid Cafe: Nothing to write home about, but a decent basic, budget option for quick casual meals. Bonus: breakfast all day, friendly service.

Rooms in the West Tower were ok-sized, seemed reasonably clean. You can fit 5 people in a standard tower room, with 2 on each bed and one on chair cushions, if you're really trying to maximize a budget.  Pillows and beds could have been more comfortable, though.  Bathroom was spacious and had a separate tub and shower.  Housekeeping did miss servicing one room when folks slept in pretty late, they should step up their schedule to accommodate a Vegas schedule. And be sure to use the ""Privacy"" door hanger, or you WILL be woken up by knocking and someone coming into your room around 9 am.

Pool area was spacious; busy, but we managed to find a couple free chairs at mid-day/early afternoon, and could comfortably relax in the pool and quickly get decent drinks from the pool bar.

Location is not ideal. You can use the tram to get up to Excalibur and close to New York, New York, but mid-strip will be a lot of cab rides or a looooong walk. The underground connection with Mandalay Bay does add a lot of food and shopping choices.

Bottom line: if you're on a budget (or get a deal/comped room here), go for it. If you can splurge, stay somewhere mid-strip or on the monorail route and a little fancier. As always, bring comfortable shoes, flip-flops or something, for daytime and extra-late nights, cause your strappy heels will get uncomfortable fast strutting around the casino or dance floor.",review,6LM_Klmp3hOP0JmsMCKRqQ

When it was Spring AZ Restaurant Week I had no hesitation about which place to make a reservation at. I had a girlfriend host a bachelorette party at this very restaurant a couple of years ago (coincidentally, also during Restaurant Week!) and remember being BLOWN away. I've raved to my husband since about it. 

We snagged reservations for one of the few nights we could make it and came down with an appetite and high expectations. And Noca certainly met, if not surpassed them. I'll break the food down by course. 

They started us off with an amuse bouche of deep fried risotto balls. It was fragrant with saffron and piping hot- so hot they warn you it's hot when it gets served to you. The only crime committed here is that I don't get a giant plateful of these crispy balls to nom to my heart's content. :P I also got the Nocarita, and am confessing to a growing love of smoky salt. There's nothing like taking a refreshing sip of cocktail and then a lick of smoky, salty flavor. So lovely. 

For our first course I got the heirloom tomato salad, whilst my husband got the meatball panino. Both were good, though perhaps a bit unmemorable. I do remember being impressed by my salad, more so than his meatball panino. I got the kurobuta pork loin for my entree, and my husband got the hangar steak for his. Both were exquisite- perfectly done. My pork loin was tender and the prioscuitto wrapped about it was awesome. I did like the spicy tomato jam, but remember that it was so overpowering in taste that I didn't eat my mashed potatoes with it. Simply because those potatoes were so damned good I wanted to savor them in all their creamy, silky, buttery glory. His steak was tender and juicy and perfectly beefy. The more I grow to enjoy steak the more I realize that a great steak really just stands on its own. No need for fancy sauces. Just salt and pepper and that lovely, juicy, tender beefiness. That's all you need. The roasted mushrooms made my inner hobbit want to burst out into song and dance. And again, dem mashed potatoes. Man. 

Now I'll have to say the desserts didn't read so impressively. I mean. Donuts and the Noca version of ho-ho's? Uh. Okay. But I chose the ho-ho, because I love chocolate, and my husband got the donuts, just so we could try both. And wow. Talk about simplicity executed perfectly. The donuts were fresh out of the fryer, crispy but not greasy, and perfectly fluffy on the inside. The dipping sauces were great. And my plain ol' ho-ho? Was this just dense, just soft enough chocolate cake enrobed with chocolate. it should be too rich but it wasn't. It should have been a bit too dry, like the hostess cakes. But it also wasn't. It was good enough that we started rhapsodizing about it with the couple dining next to us. 

Yeah. It was just that good. Needless to say, we'll be back for sure.

My mom recently took me out on a date to Harvest when I was visiting home, and was it a delight! We had a doll of a server (the wonderful Stina H!...yay for yelp connections!) and some great food.  I love the atmosphere and the lovely lighting at Harvest - something about good lighting really makes me happy.

We started off with a wonderful bottle of CakeBread Cellar's wine and the roasted beet app. Perfect. I was less enthused about my entree of beef tenderloin (too straightforward?), but happy to find out that Harvest will actually cook your meat to what you request.  Too many times I have asked for medium rare, and my order comes out more grey than pink.  Well, this time it came out more red than my liking, which is always WAY easier to fix, and they had no problem doing that for me. Maybe I need to re-educate myself on what rare vs. med rare vs medium look like:)

My mom loved her black cod entree, and we both were sent over the edge by the cheese plate and dessert. The selection of cheeses included a wonderful house-made olive bread (oh my god, so good), quince, and some candied walnuts. Our dessert of panna cotta went well with their huge list of after dinner drinks (ports, dessert wines, sherry, cognac galore!). Yum. We had a great time!

The store is huge!  You have electronic booths (cellular services), food court-type options (Jollibee's, a Chinese restaurant and a Filipino bakery) and of course, groceries.  I love how cheap everything is in the produce department. Some of my favorites like bitter melon and other squashes seem to be substantially cheaper than other grocery stores like Smith's or Albertson's.  What I love is the fact that this store also has everything I grew up with.  It's like going through the Asian food aisle at the store...except it's the whole store!  Then, you get to the meat and fish section.  That's where the heart of the store is.  So many types of fish!  So many types of meat.  All kinds of meat parts: pork, chicken and beef.  The back counters are super efficient.  What I love is the fact that you can grab fish, like catfish, take a number and ask the back counter employees to deep fry the fish.

If you are a meat eater, you will LOVE this place. They have everything from sirloin, to ribeye, to filet mignon, to lamb, and chicken. My favorite was the ""house special."" I don't remember what kind of cut it was but it was simply amazing. 

First of all if you have never been, I think you should know that the ambiance is slightly upscale and although some people were dressed casually, I would personally feel more comfortable if I dressed up the next time I dine here.  Secondly,  the price was about $120 for two people with non-alcoholic drinks. It sounds a little high for the average Joe; however,  I really think you get your money's worth because the quality of the food is so great, and it's all you can eat. Bottom line--it's worth it. 

The place itself is very large and BUSY. Might seem overwhelming if you've never been, but as soon as you walk in, someone will seat you and explain to you how the concept works. You will then be given a small cardboard coaster. One side is green and the other is red. Green means you are ready for the meats, red means stop. You are then free to go to the salad bar...but take it easy because the fun hasn't even begun. 

When you are done with your salad, turn your coaster to green, but be forwarned, people will come out of nowhere at really fast ninja speeds and inundate you with all the steak of your dreams lol. I can't say I remember all what I was specifically offered (it all seems like a magical blurr now). Once you've had enough turn your coaster to red to signal the servers to stop. 

Somewhere in between you will also be served mashed potatoes, polenta, fried bananas, and the most amazing cheese bread ever. EVER. 

The only thing I didn't like is that at one point my husband asked if they had grilled pineapple (apparently some Brazilian steakhouses offer this option? Idk). The waiter seemed really annoyed but said he would ask. I then observed him walking away, but not towards the kitchen or to ask anyone in particular.  As a matter of fact he just continued serving other people and never bothered to come back with a ""yay"" or a ""nay."" We were also charged for a drink we never ordered, but that was solved right away so no biggie. 

All in all, everyone else was super helpful/pleasant so I can't base my entire experience on the actions of one bad waiter. I personally had a great time and ate to my heart's delight. Verdict: 2 thumbs up.",review,OE5nAmaSVaopeRS1Cs9Kuw

We took photos in various spots around Springs Preserve and it was nice to have McKenzi's expertise in choosing where to take each photo. 

She even brought some alphabet blocks to place in a few shots and encouraged us beforehand to bring some of my daughter's favorite toys. These items brought such a nice touch to the photos and helped to capture this special time in my daughter's childhood.

With items like Pain Perdue Stuffed French Toast, Eggs Benedict Florentine and a Chipotle Breakfast Burrito it was a difficult decision.  I, however, settled on the healthiest option (I checked the caloric content on the website), the Capresse Omlette which was just delish and includes diced tomatoes, red onions and basil topped with sliced tomatoes and fresh mozzerella and a tomato cream sauce which I ordered on the side.  My dining partner ordered the Ham & Cheddar Croissant (a whopping 1,235 calories, but apparently worth it) with breakfast potatoes.  So, along with being a price Nazi, I've become a calorie Nazi.

1. location - it's dead center of the strip. If you like to casino hop, this is great for you. I've been to Vegas many times and always rent a car. I rarely, if ever, walk to other casinos nearby. But just in case you do...you're in luck. 

2. There are hot bitches everywhere. Like 88 year-old hot bitches with a cig strapped on their acrylic nails. 

3. The rooms are very, very quiet and this is coming from a noise sensitive person. 

4. The housekeeping staff was extremely nice and very efficient. 

the bad:

1. smoke. everywhere. Our floor was non-smoking, yet it always smelled like a chimney. 

2. Tube televisions. Even my broke ass has had a flat screen for five years. A billion dollar corporation can't upgrade? 

3. no restaurants at which I would dine within the hotel. yuk. 

4. While the room was clean and bathroom was surprisingly nice, the entire hotel just felt dated and dirty. If I were the owners, I'd tear it down. It so reminds me of the dumps where I stayed in Daytona Beach at spring break in 1992. 

5. The crowd/scene just wasn't my thing. I don't know how to phrase it nicely, so I won't. 

My traveling companion and I had a good time despite the poor quality of the hotel, however I would not stay here again, even for free.",review,vT12uXtdBQ10_lUcl-M40w

I was there with my girlfriend, who would be taking the MCAT early the next morning, so we really just needed to rent a car, get to our hotel, and relax for the next day.  I had a corporate reservation with Hertz, but after our flight arrived late we realized that we would have to scramble to pick up the car before Hertz closed at 5pm.  We called the Hertz rep at the pickup location, and he couldn't have been more rude and unprofessional.  Called the Hertz corporate line to report the experience and were promised a follow up response, but of course nothing ever came.  Needless to say, I won't use Hertz again.

As luck would have it, there was an Enterprise a few blocks away from Hertz, and even though we knew it was closed, out of desperation we knocked on the door after seeing some movement inside.  The nicest team of people opened the door and asked how they could help.  After explaining our situation, they re-opened the store, rented us a car at a totally reasonable price, and got us out the door within 10 minutes.  And they did it in the most friendly, professional, and helpful manner, thanking us for coming in.  The contrast between our experience at Hertz and our experience at Enterprise was shocking.  

The entire team was great, but the standout was Armin Smailagic (we got his card), who is the branch manager.  Thanks so much for your help, Armin, you really saved us that night!",review,9f2Ep2KReXmgXxdtrA83GA

Anyway, I called and asked if they take rabbits. Instead of Holly just saying no, she called and researched locations online, called to confirm their details, called neighboring hotels, called veterinary offices, and even found information from the House Rabbit Society about traveling with pets across the country and boarding pets. Despite it being a busy time at night and me not even being a guest, I never had anyone so proactive and helpful based off of a simple request. I was literally blown away with how helpful she is.

In the end I ordered the bacon, swiss, and avocado scramble with crispy potatoes. I will not lie, everything on my plate was decent, just not spectacular. The scramble itself was fluffy with cheese oozing out. The bacon gave it a little saltiness from the otherwise bland combination. The avocado was sparse compared to the generous helping of everything else on the plate. The potatoes were my favorite part. Usually I can do without all the extra carbs, but these were fried crispy with the center not being dried out which was then tossed with some diced red onions.

Walking in, this was probably one of the nicest Ethiopian restaurants in town.  The modern furniture immediately sets the tone, along with a bar on the right and a small stage area in the back.

On a Saturday night, we were the only customers.  We weren't concerned though because our previous experiences at other Ethiopian restaurants have always left us in the minority.

Queen of Sheba's menu is very limited - with only 15 items.  Of course, we knew exactly what we wanted and they definitely had it.

#4. Kitfo ""Lean red chopped beef minced, blended and delicately seasoned in hot spice."" ($8.99)  We made a point of saying we wanted it raw, and again, the eyebrows were raised.  And when it arrived, it was slightly warmed and tasted just divine.  The portion was quite generous and we agreed, this was probably the best kitfo we've had so far! 

#13. Vegetarian Combo ""A combination of split lentil peas, cabbage and potatoes/carrots and fresh salad."" ($8.99)  It arrived with green and red lentils, yellow beans, steamed cabbage, and string beans.  The waitress asked if we wanted cheese, which we definitely did, and we also asked for the red chili powder.  There wasn't any 'fresh salad', but we could care less because their red and green lentils were so good here.  They had good spices mixed in, and we were loving it. The yellow beans were really good too.  The string beans and steamed cabbage are okay, as they were the same as the other restaurants.  We agreed that they do their legumes really well here, and probably would just order a plate of the red lentils on its own, or even the green lentils or yellow beans.

Service was fine - one waitress who took care of us the whole time.  She was pleasant, but we had some language barriers about ordering water which eventually worked itself out.  She came by to check on us and brought out more injera when she saw we were getting low.  The bathrooms could use a bit of a cleanup, the men's room smelled like urine and the women's room had graffiti and lacked toilet paper and paper towels.  

Overall, Queen of Sheba is one of our fave Ethiopian restaurants of the five we tried.  With their limited menu, it may be challenging for newbies.  But they offer the staples we like, and we'll probably return when we crave raw beef!

Per their website, they offer live reggae on Friday nights.",review,75n7FVIObWM3iMf95duQOw

Get there around noon on a beautiful Saturday day. No line, walked right in. Great start. Order some drinks and a few pizzas. Prices seemed kinda steep but for the best pizza in the world I would pay double. My party of 3 and I are very excited about this pizza until it arrives at our table.

We arrived at 7pm and luckily since this was the second opening night it was not ""packed""! We were greeted with a warm welcome and given a choice of seating. The atmosphere inside appeared very comfortable with tall tables to stand around, two long bars, some small round tables and a few living room areas with leather seating. They had three different patio areas one with a fireplace which was already taken. We chose to sit on the patio which was very comfortable with plenty of heat (outside temp about 53). They also had a GREAT sound system playing light jazz! Our server immediately brought water and menus to the table. He also had a penlight so that we could read the menu..nice touch! The menu was simple and offered a variety of lite fare items: salads, soup, sandwiches, bruschetta and cheese platter. 

We started with wine, bruschetta and pannini. We thought our waiter forgot about us on the patio as our food came before the wine! But he assured us he didn't. For $7.95 you can select four different types of bruschetta which is fun to have a sample of each! I selected the tomato basil, hummus, peppered steak and chicken salad. Enjoyed all but the steak which was too chewy and heavily seasoned. Our waiter asked how everything was and I commented on the steak. He was so eager to please and suggested I try the goat cheese and yellow/red peppers. Much better! The ham pannini sandwich had plenty of thin sliced ham and was very tasty. I would forgo the chips next time and try a salad or soup instead. 

It was a great experience, loved the atmosphere and felt very welcomed. In fact when we left the owner came out to wave goodnight.

The wait was LONG, clocking in at about 3 hours.  It went by fairly fast, and waitresses brought water bottles around for everyone.  One thing I wish someone would have remedied was the screaming kid who wouldn't stop crying for the ENTIRE hour wait in the inside line.  Cramped quarters, low ceiling, shrieking child.  Not necessary, one of the parents should have taken him out of there (and one of Wynn's staff should have told them so).  
Once we were seated, we asked our waitress if she could point out for us which dishes were vegan.  To our surprise and delight, she went and got a chef to personally take us to every single station and show us which options were vegan.  He was so friendly and went into detail about several dishes.  My favorite part was how the crowds parted ways for us.  It was definitely star treatment.  :-)
The food was absolutely incredible.  The highlight for me was the pasta bar, where you can pick your ingredients and sauce.  The alfredo (vegan!!) was ridiculously rich and perfect.  I'd live on that stuff.

The MOST important is NOT, however, the cigars.  Yes, the cigars were great -- and they have something for everyone . . . as long as it's made by Fuente.  (Fortunately, however, I like their cigars so this wasn't a problem.)  No, the best thing about this place is that it's the ONLY place in Las Vegas I've found that has (not ""good"" but) truly GREAT ESPRESSO!

OK, yeah, it's the cigars that draw people to this place.  And, as I say, they have a good selection, all the accessories, AND it's the only place in the Forum Shops one can light up.  They have  ""outdoor"" seating (I mean, come on, it's Vegas -- who wants to be outside in 101-degree heat???  You're ""outside"" in the Forum Shops!  They also have a dark wood bar and a couple of tables ""inside"", with a flat panel TV tuned to whatever game is on at the time.  

They offer a full bar, but surprisingly limited in what rums they offer.  Well, I was surprised, based on the fact they're going for the look and atmosphere of ""old"" Cuba.  A lot more whisky than rum, though the 12-year old Montecristo does provide a nice rum to sip while enjoying a cigar.  They also make the best Mojito I had while in Vegas, too . . . .

What's not to love?

AND . . . let me add that, while it IS true the crowd is mostly men, there were a number of women here -- some enjoying a cigar, some now -- AND not every table here was smoking, either.  One couple showed up and ordered tea.  Apparently they were regulars, too, as the waitress knew them be name.  One cup of green tea and an Earl Grey later, and they were off . . .

I think we have been spoiled when it comes to steakhouses because of all the meals we have eaten at Capital Grille. We started at the bar and were pleased to find out that during happy hour you could get wines for $6 and cocktails for $9. We tried the classic gin martini with blue cheese stuffed olives. It was delicious. We enjoyed the music they were playing and the bartender was very good. They were nice enough to transfer our bar tab to our table. The dining room is nice, but it was a little chilly and the lighting was too bright. We noticed that after we were seated we couldn't hear the music anymore, which was a bummer. We don't want to see the blood on a medium rare steak and spend the whole night listening to other tables conversations. 

The fresh bread and butter was good. We ordered 6 blue point oysters on the half shell, a wedge salad, surf and turf, filet topped with blue cheese and red wine demo glacé with Alaska king crab legs and a side of creamed spinach. The oysters were weird. They were huge, which is great, but they weren't fully shucked. They were served with cocktail sauce, horseradish, and balsamic vinegar. The cocktail sauce was super sweet, tasted like ketchup. We spiced it up with the horseradish, but it wasn't quite right. They tasted weird, and we couldn't place what was off. The wedge salad was good, but there was a $2 charge for blue cheese crumbles, which is silly. The bacon on the salad tasted great, but had the consistency of bacon dust, like they took the bacon, put it into a food processor and obliterated it. When the steak landed they brought it with lobster. We had ordered king crab, so they took the lobster and rushed the crab. We enjoyed the steak in the meantime which was served with a side of au gratin potatoes, snap peas and a baby carrot. The potatoes were bland, the baby carrot undercooked, but the snap peas were great. The creamed spinach wasn't anything special, but the steak was very good, and the king crab was good once we got it. 

As far as service goes, the wait staff uses a team approach, which is great for managing multiple tables. Maestro's uses a similar approach for flawless execution. It wasn't flawless here, but was decent. For example, we ordered a bottle of wine with one person and were asked by a different person on the team if we wanted wine. Not a big deal, but an opportunity for improvement. 

Overall, a very decent experience and I am glad we checked it out. However, if we are going to drop that kind of money, we will opt for Capital Grille.",review,ar90fbRbQtiyZLtwjwwXUg

I mean, why wouldn't I jump to write the review on this awsome burger joint right after my experience? Must have been the food coma from this yummy food.. or perhaps the beers that followed the food... oh well.

So I stopped by Bachi Burger with some friends (party of 5) sometime in the middle of August. I was worried about the previous reviews about the service. But we had no problems. Our server was awesome! It was about 9:30p and the place was half full. I wish I remembered the name of our server, he seemed so happy and passionate about his job! And gave us recommendations and whatnot.

So we started off with the truffle fries and I got the Kiki Burger, the BF got the Ronin, and our friends got a ronin, kiki, and a traditional burger. And the bf got some kind of lemonade thing, can't remember what it was, but it was good!

Fries came out pretty quick and they were gone in less than a minute! yummy stuff. The burgers did take quite a while. But the server did come by to check on us, so at least we weren't ignored. What sucked was that our burgers didn't all come out together. So some started grubbing before others cause we were starving and didn't want the food to go cold!

LOVED the kiki burger. Something about the sweet bun, it makes the burger. The flavors lived in happy harmony. Oh and the dipping sauce, interesting flavor. They gave me the wrong sauce by accident so I got to try 2 different sauces with my burger.

Haven't been back there since but I sure hope I get the chance again soon! LOVING Bachi Burger! Though this review may seem kinda not so helpful since I can't remember the details of my visit.. but I had to say something. I need to try their whole menu..! And I am sure I won't be dissappointed.

I am beginning to become more and more weary of reviews for Asian food on Yelp. This isn't the first time I've trusted Yelp with Asian food and ended up disappointed. 4 stars and 600 reviews? How can that many people have indiscernible palettes???? 

First I noticed right off the bat - the FISH IS FROZEN!!!! Wake up call everyone - when you walk into a sushi joint and the fish is PRE-SLICED, you are not eating fresh fish!!!!!!!! Never have I EVER had sushi where the chefs do not slice the fish from a refrigerated, fresh raw fish steak. I know a lot of people like that the sushi comes out quickly - and it does, to a point where it just doesn't seem right, and guess what, that's because the fish has been pre-sliced and it is not fresh. That in itself is enough to give 1 star to this place. What a disgrace. 

We started off eating the highly regarded ""seafood salad."" Looked like the ocean threw up a bunch of reject ahi tuna chunks. There were pieces of fish that were unidentifiable, sitting atop some julienned daikon radish in a pool of spicy-sweet sauce, similar to the sauce that comes in poke salads. There were red specks floating in the sauce that gave it a spicy kick. Each seafood salad looks different (according to the pics on here); mine had two random pieces of tempura in it, that were soggy from sitting in the pool of sauce. Okay. 

We also ordered gyoza (pot sticker dumplings)- which honestly is a waste of stomach space when you're out to eat sushi, but gyoza's good, so whatever. The gyoza was deep fried, but it wasn't crispy. Gyoza is definitely frozen as well, and since when was gyoza by default deep-fried and you didn't get at least the option to have it steamed and fried on the bottom like, you know, traditional gyoza? 

The test of fresh, high-quality fish can be found in an order of sea urchin. The caliber of sea urchin in a sushi joint will reveal the condition of other fish. For those who have eaten fresh, creamy sea urchin, you know that the color of it is a mild beige; it should look nice and plump, and taste like the ocean made flesh. My sea urchin was BROWN and was limp like it just gave up on life on top of the rice. It did NOT taste like the ocean made flesh. It tasted the way sea urchin tastes those times you have to mentally convince yourself that it is actually good, that you should actually swallow it even though your taste buds may be screaming out otherwise. Oh, also, my mackerel was dry. Fresh mackerel, like other fresh fish, should have a sheen to it. But of course, if you pre-cut your fish, dryness is to be expected. 

Keep in mind I ordered all nigiri sishi here - with the exception of one roll that my dinner companion wanted to try. I'm sorry to break it to all you sushi-happy people, but if you only order rolls when you go eat sushi, you don't really like sushi. You like frikkin mayo, bitch. As a Japanese person, I know that it is a waste of stomach space to fill yourself up on fried batter, eel sauce, and spicy mayo. Really it is just a way to cover up the flavor of delicious raw fish. Then again - this place doesn't use delicious raw fish so maybe it is a better idea to mask the flavor of it. Believe me when I say Japanese people don't fuck with rolls the way non-Japanese sushi-eaters do. There is nothing wrong with choosing that route, though, I guess, and the roll was tasty, so I suppose with the price, this is somewhere you should come if you only eat fillers. 

Lastly - I always order a hand roll with shiso leaf and ume (plum) paste as my last sushi - it is very refreshing and cleanses your palette before dessert. When I asked the sushi chef to make it for me, he asked WHAT IT WAS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I won't even comment further on this. That is just not right. 

I know this review was full of vitriol, but someone had to say something. I do not understand how this place is so popular. This place is to sushi as Taco Bell is to Mexican food. It didn't taste bad, and that's the only thing I can say about it. Taco Bell doesn't taste bad either. I would much rather spend a few more dollars at a Japanese-owned Goyemon or Sushi Mon and know I am getting fresh, high-quality fish. There are only so many meals I will eat in my life, and I regret having wasted one of them on this place. Two stars for punctual, friendly service (only from the servers, not the sushi chef).

As an overview, the food is excellent, the service is professional and fast, the noise level is a bit loud when crowded (like Cheesecake Factory), the lighting is low, the prices are on the higher side, and you get seated almost immediately with reservations. We came for dinner on two occasions around 6pm both on Saturday.

The food is one of the highlights.  I recommend the 8oz filet, or the crab and shrimp cakes, or the lamb chops, and the sampler bruschetta, the Tiramisu, traditional cheesecake, and the Torta Di Cioccolata (like a fancy lava cake with Gelato).  I recommend those  since those were the only dishes my wife and I have tried so far and they were very good!  

The beef and lamb were cooked perfectly to order and seasoned just right.  The roasted veggies that came with our entrées were very good although mine were slightly over seasoned. 

The crab and shrimp cakes were awesome...  not too much breading,  not overcooked, and the quality of the seafood was great.  When I took my first bite it reminded me of San Francisco (that where I grew up).  The crispy potatoes that came with this dish was really good and so were the roasted veggies.

The bruschetta was pretty pricey but was pretty good... if you want to skip the appetizers, that's ok because the rest of the food and experience is more than enough to satisfy and leave you with a smile.

The desserts are a wonderful sweet topping to the experience here.  The cheesecake, has no graham crust but I guess that's traditional.  It was still really good.  The Tiramisu was just the way I like it.  Anyways...all of the desserts that I've listed above go well with the coffee served here.  FYI when the waiter presents you with the dessert tray, they are presented in little cups, however they do have the regular size versions of those.

The portions were the right size.  Let me put it this way,  when we left, we did not feel like we overate.

My wife and I have come here twice in the past two weeks and we love it.  The first time was on a date night and we were very happy.  The second time we came was for my dad's 70th bday.  My parent were happy and my wife and I were happy... Good times!

They even were nice enough to hold it till 6pm since we were heading to the pool at the time they called to say our room was ready. 

Secondly, there was a huge discrepancy on our room bill. We disputed the charges accordingly and it was taken care of in the most professional and humblest manner. We felt like they really knew what they were doing and we weren't given the run around.

On the third attempt, mostly due to lack of casual evening options currently available in the MGM Grand, I ended up walking out due to what I deem to be generally poor attentiveness by the ""General Manager"" and the staff under his charge. I have visited a number of Michael Mina's' restaurants' in various cities along the west coast and had always had an enjoyable experience, when you place a name like Michael Mina on the door of a pub you rightly expect a whole other level of pub. I can't say my experience with Pub 1842 in the MGM Grand met Mina level expectations. I will start with the good:

- location good relative to the MGM hotel layout
- nice floorplan and decor 
- very good beer selection on tap and bottled
- good wine and liquor selection
- good menu 
- taste of food was good
- being a pub, there is a potential to fill what I would opine as a void in venue options absent in most other casino/hotels in Las Vegas, the only other pub I know of is the Ri Ra in between the Mandalay and Luxor, at least as it pertains to casino/hotel interiors.

The average & inconsistent:
- Greeters/hosts at front door very average to disappointing, don't look you in the eye when they speak to you, distracted & no smile. I generally felt that they didn't understand that there is a higher level expectation when employed by an establishment bearing Michael Mina's name, hence his reputation. I have to say I have received a higher quality greeting at Hooters establishments.

- Servers in restaurant, while generally friendly, were very inconsistent and NOT knowledgeable about the menu or dishes they are charged with serving to the customers. 

- Servers not knowledgeable about the establishment, there is a unique feature in the Pub 1842 in that there are a few taps with seating around them. We inquired of the staff on our first visit how that worked and they replied an uninspiring ""I don't know"" however, a fellow customer overheard us and was kind enough to explain.

- Bartenders and barbacks inconsistently attentive in regards to consistently checking in with customers, was challenging to get their attention, even while not busy, barbacks were of no help to customers where they could have assisted the customers via getting the bartenders attention. Took a long time to get the check and equally as long to process the payment.

The Bad: (In my opinion)

- General Manager, in my opinion, doesn't get it. As previously mentioned I walked out on my third visit over some confusion regarding seating directions from the host staff and generally rude attitude of one of the servers. I attempted to address a gentleman that stated he was the GM, yet, he really didn't introduce himself. I explained the situation and he seemed genuinely disinterested in assisting us, so, we decided to go elsewhere. We ended up at Wolfgang Puck's establishment in the middle of the casino and had a delightful experience, good food and service, despite the fact that my colleagues and myself being very underdressed for the venue, relative to the other patrons.

All that being said, given the nice decor and unique self serve tap feature available there seem like there is some potential for Pub 1842, perhaps a rearrangement of the staff might bring out that potential. In summary, currently, given the gourmet prices I would not return to the Pub 1842's less than gourmet service and would not recommend it until some service improvements are put in place.",review,riTkPznlAPl86dazAjPO3A

However, we're glad that we went because this place is not as bad as some of the reviews.
First impression: this place is quite nice, despite construction on Williamson St and rennovation on the front porch (I believe they want to open an outdoor patio). Our waiter was super friendly and quite charming.
Now, the most interesting and important part, the foods!
Pork bun (2 pieces for $6): yummy yummy yummy.  Love the soft bun, super love the fatty pork, love the pickles, and the sauce. For me it was an umami experience (sweet, savory goodness). I also added the spicy bomb (I'll talk about this later) to add a little kick to it. In short, it was heaven in my mouth.
Large pork and chives dumpling ($8): Errr not worth the price. I don't think it's homemade but I could be wrong. For 8 dollar, I can go to a Japanese grocery store and get a pork dumpling and you won't taste the difference.
Tonkatsu ramen: Good noodle, great soup. However, the soup wasn't hot enough that you smell the porkiness of cold ramen (i want to say fishy, but not sure if they have fish stock at all). For the price and the small portion, I'd say it's overpriced. The only place I spent 12 bucks for a bowl of ramen was in NY, but the portion was bigger and it's NY afterall. I  We also added the spicy bomb for a dollar hoping it's something interesting but turns out it's like sambal oelek and we're very dissapointed with this addition. Why can't they give this for free?

I was terribly disappointed when they brought to my table a paper cup filled with a cloudy liquid and a glob of mayo floating in it. When I questioned him, he said that they no longer serve the corn on the cob. Now they serve a small cup with a little bit of corn kernels at the bottom, and the rest of the cup filled with cloudy water, with a glob of mayo and a little bit of crumbled cojita cheese. It wasn't good. 

The tacos however were great!  The ribeye tacos were simple but delicious. diced ribeye, cabbage and a slice of avocado on a small corn tortilla. The Volteado taco was especially wonderful. A  small corn tortilla topped with a little heap of a wonderfully flavored pork and a slice of cheese, then the whole thing is flipped over face down on the grill so the cheese gets crispy and toasty, then topped with an avocado slice. 

The red hot sauce at the little salsa station was exceptional as well. it was really spicy and velvety smooth, It was even kind of creamy. Judging by the creaminess and richness of it, I'm pretty sure it has some heavy cream in it.  The rich salsa paired with the simple clean tacos made for an amazing meal.

After my meal I bought a churro from the pastry case. It wasn't good. It tasted old and was really tough and chewy. 

Oh! And when I first walked it, the girl at the counter gave me a sample of the soup of the day. It was cream of zucchini, which sounds kind of weird, but it was great as well. it was creamy and rich with corn and bacon in it. I wasn't in the mood for soup but it was definitely delicious. Service was friendly too.

I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the weird corn water and old churro, but it was an overall good experience. I would highly recommend the Volteado tacos and Paquime in general.",review,QRkwEMoYWuT_uTqBfT1kbw

I've been looking forward to eating at this place for dinner for a few years! I loved the idea of individual little pans/pots- like a mini plate! But alas, I am craving for something more. 

I tried probably 95% of the stuff, including the salad bar. 
Here's some of the highlights and lowlights for the dinner buffet service:

The Good:

Cool that they have different kinds of stuff, like bone marrow, shrimp and grits, gazpacho, a good selection of charcuterie. 

short ribs- yum
watermelon with goat cheese and balsamic vinegar salad
asian food as a whole was decent
lamb was yum
gelato! 
kale salad- a little too much dressing though
i personally liked their crab legs! 
make-your-own pasta. my friend made one with 2 cheeses, chicken and something else and it was...amazeballs. 
salad bar as a whole
sweet potato gnocchi - YESSS. 

The Bad:
gazpacho was gross. too bellpeppery. go to serrano's for the BEST. 
roast beef was not good
wings were BLAND! :( :( :( and i love me some wings!
Got the boar sliders- the bread was bleh and super dry

The Decent/OK

Bone marrow..just gotta pick the right one
Dessert was for the most part okay
They have chocolate covered strawberries! but for some reason, they tasted weird. I just took off the chocolate and ate the fruit! 

I think next time I should come for breakfast instead.

I've never seen such a high concentration of good-looking young folks in any other Vegas hotel. It was puzzling, disorienting, somewhat damaging to the self-conscious, but certainly pleasing to the eye.

The wrap-around suites are great - undoubtedly the best I've ever come across in my stays in Vegas. There's a large balcony that wraps around the whole room, giving you astonishing views of the strip and the Bellagio fountain - especially if you're lucky enough to get a room on a high floor. Not to mention, there's a washer, dryer, and full kitchen set-up, which I can see being incredibly useful if you're staying for more than just a couple nights.

Lots of good establishments around the hotel - Chandelier Bar is, on a visual scale, my favorite bar in Las Vegas. Restaurants like Holsteins and STK make for good lunch and dinner stops. It's worth noting the casino only had $25 minimum blackjack tables - for scaredy cat gamblers like me, best to stick to the $10 MGM tables.

The front desk customer service is iffy. I've not personally had any big issues, but one couple in the group we traveled with were told their room wasn't available (despite booking weeks in advance). The front desk played it off as it would be free in a couple hours, and that they'd call back.

The location is perfect in my opinion. It's far enough from the strip, to feel ""resort-y"", but close enough to get to wherever you need to go in 10 minutes or less (if there's no traffic).

The shuttle was sooo convenient! We never had to drive anywhere during the entire length of our 2 trips! Loved it. 

We are not a high maintenance couple, so we were very please with all the amenities that were offered.

All in all, I have nothing negative to say about this place. The staff has always been friendly and helpful, and everything you need is offered one way or another. 

The only bummer for our last stay in March, was that the main pool was closed due to a resurfacing project, and the main pool just so happened to be right outside our balcony... :(

The Aria is apart of the new ""City Center"" and has a very modern feel. My room was clean and with the times of technology. Everything in your room can be controlled via a remote and your TV. The lights, the curtains, the central air system and so forth. It's a very neat feature which makes you feel richer than you are. 

I have been to several resorts and casinos now in Vegas and this was certainly more pricey than than the norm; you could tell it was recently built. When it cost 30 dollars to go eat at the breakfast buffet, I think you have a problem on your hands. While the found throughout was good, the service did not always hold up. I'll go into more detail there once I start reviewing the individual restaurants within. 

My final gripe comes with the vanilla smelled perfume they constantly spray throughout the hotel. At first it smells nice, but then you quickly begin to feel ill. They are mimicking the Venetian Resort which I can't stand to stay at due to this one feature. At the Venetian it is over powering and the Aria is soon to follow.

However, if price is taken into consideration, I would give this place a 3, since I think they can lower the price a little.

So why the 4 stars, you may asked? Great empanadas, great plantain chips, and great mango habanero chicken. They also gave us a free cup of soup for sample, and I personally wonder why they didn't put this on the menu instead. The beef soup (I may be wrong, but I think it's oxtail soup) is savory with a little kick of spicy flavor and just melt in your mouth. For those who read my review beofre going there, please ask the Mango man why it's not in the menu. Now let's go back to the menu..

Empanadas: we got the beef and potato, and chicken and cheese. We love it.. though the skin/wrap is little tough (but they are smart enough to chop it small to make it easier to bite, chew and digest). 
Yellow Plantain: another great appetizer. However, you pay 5.95 for 6 slices of plantain, so it's like 1 dollar for each slice. I made sure I enjoy every bite of it.
Mango Habanero chicken: spicy, salty, complex flavor that makes your tongue dance of happiness. Big portion, but again a little on the pricier side.

Finally, the 3-star explanation: I totally get that the great Mango man needs to survive, but the restaurant is small and it's a 2-man operation (the mango man in the kitchen and a waitress at the front). The service was okay but not too fast. The decoration is cool but not over the top. In fact I enjoyed my meal facing the bathroom, which is okay for me as long as the food is good.. but for the price I paid? Mmm.. not so okay.

Although there were several food vendors to choose from, the Sausagefest menu was most appealing.

My husband had the Smokey Robinson, which is a hot link with bacon, cheese, and BBQ sauce. A little too much sauce, but that was one tasty sausage. I wasn't as impressed with my bahn mi sausage. The longanisa was fine, but there wasn't enough of the toppings (cucumber, daikon, and carrots) to give it much flavor. We both enjoyed the crunchy rolls the sausages were served in, but we didn't care for the bland, overcooked fries we ordered as a side.

I'd give this place a lower grade except service was friendly and super fast, and the prices weren't bad for a food truck ($7 per sausage). If you see the Sausagefest truck rolling your way, stick with the Smokey (or maybe the Mexicali, which looked good as well), and avoid the fries.",review,zftTB9fn2g0TPWYOZC9-DA

The 1st time, it was a nice experience, not too busy, we were greeted right away, server was attentive. The food here is a better quality buffet and they have an huge variety of different foods that normally aren't seen in other Chinese buffets.  (You have to be willing to try some really different things). 

The 2nd time we came here, it was AWFUL from the start. It was busy but I wouldn't say slammed. We came in and I saw two gals by the cash register. I said hello and we waited, waited, waited for them to even LOOK UP at us. After a few MINUTES of us STARING at them they finally looked at us and then continued to ignore us. I was shocked at how they were blatantly ignoring us. Finally a 3rd girl came over and FINALLY seated us. We ended up with two very confused servers who couldn't figure out whose table it was. 

Like the time before, the food was very good, same exotic variety. When we were finished with our meal, our server took our credit card and we waited, waited, waited. After about 15 minutes of waiting for my credit card to come back to me, I got nervous and went up the cash register. As I walked up, there was my credit card-on the counter, face up, with all the numbers very clearly visible & displayed to whoever walked by it along with several other people's cards that were spread out on the counter-right next to the pathway to the door. There were 3 servers at the register, all of whom were at least 8 feet away from the cards with their backs to it while they chatted. Who knows how long any of those cards had been there. I was so furious when I saw this. I demanded to know why my credit card was sitting on the counter in the open, face up with no one even WATCHING to make sure it wasn't stolen. They had no explanation and simply spit out some lame ""I'm sorry"" to me. 

I don't care how awesome the food is, bad service is bad service. One should be able to hand a credit card to the server to pay for their meal w/o worrying about the numbers or even the card itself being stolen.

Since we all ordered what we wanted but ended up sharing, there was a big assortment of items to try.  

Three friend and I shared a white pizza, which was scrumptious, and a large salad that, thankfully, was romaine and not iceberg, which had a very good ranch dressing that we had on the side.  There were other dressings to choose from.

We also got to sample the garlic knots, veggie pizza, and the calzone.  Everything was terrific, but the calzone was extra wonderful!  

What I love most about Bambino's pizza is that the crust is not overly salty; so many other pizza joints drown their crusts in salt.  This one was perfect, and crispy, just the way I love it.

I wanted to first wanted to say that our evening would not have been nearly as good if we hadn't had the privilege of having Doug as our server.  Doug knew the menu, answered all of our questions and even gave us suggestions.  He definitely made the evening an amazing experience. Even after we left, we forgot some items at our table and he ran us down before we left to make sure that we got the items. Thank you once again Doug!!
To begin with drinks, the Plum Wine was delicious along with the green hot tea (amazingly alternating between these two drinks didn't affect the taste of either of them).
We began with the California Rolls which all of the ingredients were so fresh and amazingly tasty. Next came the Duck Sliders and the Shrimp/Veg Tempura.  The Duck Sliders were covered in a delicious sauce and were not overly greasy like some duck dishes can be. The Shrimp/Veg Tempura was also delicious and everything in this dish was very fresh as well and was not over done with the breading.
Then came the Korean Tacos and the M Girl Rolls.  The flavors for each of the ingredients were very well done and complemented each other impeccably, and the sauce that came with the tacos was scrumptious. In addition the ""tortillas"" used were so light and fluffy that you could eat these all night and not get full from the bread. I was worried about trying the M Girl Rolls since there were jalapeños in the roll since I can't do many spicy foods. However you couldn't feel the heat from the jalapeños and it really just added to the flavor of the rolls.
Some of the main courses included the Emperor Fried Rice and Gochujang Pork. The Emperor Fried Rice had large chunks of crab meat and also gained some heat the more you ate.  Then the Gochujang Pork plate was delicious as well and the sauce that was covering the pork and the veggies was perfect and not over powering.
I am a person who LOVES deserts and I will say that this place did not disappoint what so ever.

I had to knock off a star because, honestly, our waiter was terrible, not just at this pricepoint, but even if he was a waiter for Applebees.  He was a nice guy and trying hard (I guess?) but he was shockingly bad, like, unacceptably bad at a place this nice.  I mean, he was comical... dropping forks, plates, bumping into fellow waiters, etc... multiple times.  I used to wait tables as a teenager and I was never so clumsy.

Anyway...

We had a reservation for 7:00pm on a weekend, we were seated promptly on the outdoor porch area, ordered some amazing apps.  We had a party of about eight, two of which didn't have water.  We had to ask the waiter a couple times for the water, which he kept forgetting.  We finally found the guy who gave us the bread (amazing variety) and he took care of it right away.  The waiter then went MIA.  We finally had the buser (the bread guy) flag him down and he came back over to take our orders around 7:30.  I only ordered a Diet Coke to drink (too tired for any alcohol).  He never brought it, went MIA again.  

We waited and waited and waited for our food.  Tables seated around us were getting their food and beverages before us even though they were seated long after we were, so I know the kitchen wasn't slow.  

We started walking around the restaurant and got talking to the manager, who was so ridiculously nice.  We were admiring the wine cellar and he took us in to show us, which was so cool of him.  That was definitely a really cool note of the night.  

We finally got our food, no joke, at 8:45.  That would normally be fine if people were getting their drinks filled and so on.  

Still no Diet Coke.  

The food arrived at 8:45, I reminded the waiter of my Diet Coke, he said he's be right on it.  I ordered the cod.  Uh-mazing.  Everyone's food was spot on.  We were starving so we 'enjoyed' our food a little more quickly than usual, done probably in 15-20 minutes.  

No Diet Coke still.  Our of principle, I told one of the busers that I ordered a Diet Coke which I never received... and I had it within a minute.  Top notch on that end.  

With all of that said, one terrible waiter couldn't deter an amazing nice of good food and conversation in a great place.  If we had any other waiter, it would be five stars.  I know for sure that other tables had top notch waiters, which is expected at a place like this.  Ours, unfortunately, was in way over his head.  

Paying the bill was the same thing... trying to track him down... waiting for the receipt to sign... then waiting for him to take it up.  We didn't get out of there until, literally 10pm.  

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Get away from the pretentious, overpriced places in the middle of the strip and enjoy a night out here, trust me on this - just avoid our waiter ;)",review,Pz7SWZQhxL6ZbhL9jE2NTA

No exaggeration at all. If you've ever taken an art class or happened to stumble upon this place, well my friend, you've really found a great place!

I first heard about this place when I took a drawing class at CSN in the winter of '08. I was sent off with a long list of materials to have before my next class and their entire staff was so great! They took the time to help me get everything I needed and jumped me to the front to pay-- no wait! I had such a positive experience going there back and forth for different pencils and gadgets that I come here for everything that has anything to do with art. I recently came here to fill up on oil paint for a recent art gallery for church. I knew exactly where everything was because sometimes, change isn't a good thing :)

In my most recent experience, I came across plenty of coupons and emails about sales and decided to take advantage of it. As busy as I can get, I didn't have my coupon from the mail on me so my gf called the store and spoke with someone about not having the coupon with us, but being that we were already on the road heading to the store, one the sales associates told her that they have some extra so come on down to the store.  I really needed some canvas ASAP so I can start on my painting!

Compared to stores like Michael's or even Walmart, Blick is the shh! I can spend hours upon hours browsing and making a gigantic wish list for all the cool stuff they have in there.

Some don't like the pool because it is crowded and can be loud in certain areas (namely, around the lazy river). I, however, love the lively energy of the pool. The music, the people, the lazy river and flowing drinks all add up to a great day in the sun. Besides, if you really do want a quieter lounging experience, stay in the first pool to the right. The music is more mellow there (a lot of Classic Rock and Oldies) and the crowd isn't there for the party so you won't be disturbed while taking your sun-induced naps. And, if you do choose to drink, the cocktail servers are more attentive in this section since they don't have 20 drunk frat boys yelling for another round constantly.

Also, this pool is one of the best places to people watch. I have seen crazy, gross, hilarious and sad all in one day before.

Now for the rooms. The beds here are the most comfortable beds I have slept on in Vegas. They look nice too, with white comforters accented by navy blue (in most rooms). I am often times tempted to go to Vegas just to sleep all weekend in one of those beds. The standard rooms aren't anything spectacular, but those beds make up for the lack of pizazz. 

The rooms in the towers are nicer and more spacious than the rooms in the main hotel. Regardless of what room you stay in, YOU WILL GET LOST the first 5 times you try to get there. 

The MGM is massive. One of the biggest and most spread out casino/hotel/entertainment centers in Vegas. You can follow the signs all you want but you will still get lost. After a day or two you should get used to walking around and will only have to use the signs as a basic guide. You will know to stay to the left of such and such restaurant to get to the side of the casino that leads to the pool. You will know that if you can find the ""walk"" then you can find the pool and the chain restaurants. So on and so on. The most difficult part of navigating the MGM is realizing that despite the MGM's strip location, their lobby/valet/taxi area is relatively far off the strip on Tropicana. So if you try to find the ""front"" of the hotel by using your natural sense of direction, you will end up in the sports book. 

MGM also houses Studio 54 nightclub which is a great club several nights a week. Tuesdays and Fridays have both been fun there. 

I rarely play the table games at the MGM. The $10 tables are usually too crowded and I refuse to EVER play more than that as a minimum bet. What's the point? I can bet $50 a hand at a $10 table, but don't have to if I'm not feelin' the cards.

If you like slot machines, you will be in heaven. There are more slot machines than people on the casino floor... and the casino floor is always busy.

The dining options at MGM are varied. You can get McDonald's, greasy chinese, pizza, starbucks/cafe food or you can go to one of their many sit down restaurants. They have a buffet which is pretty decent. Coupons are always floating around for the buffet and I would definitely suggest finding one first unless you want to pay $25-$30 for brunch. The cheapest sit down is the Rainforest Cafe. 

The only ""upscale"" restaurant I have eaten at in the MGM is Wolfgang Puck Bar & Grill. It was OK but definitely not worth the [moderate] price tag and the service was far less than stellar. We actually had to send our water and glasses back because they had a weird fishy/river/mildew smell. The wine selection for ""by the glass"" was lacking. We left full, but not satisfied and vowed to go to a non-hotel restaurant the next time. Also, they claim to be a casual attire restaurant but nobody (including us because we were heading to a club afterward) was dressed casually and I'm sure anyone who did dress casually would have felt under dressed. 

This hotel isn't intended for children. It has more upscale restaurants, shows and entertainment options that most kids would not enjoy. Also, they will get tired just walking from one end to the other. I always say Circus Circus is the best kid-friendly hotel anyway (see other review). Kids will likely enjoy the lion habitat but not for long as the lions don't do much most of the time... so don't make any special trips if you are short on time. Of course, M&M World is just a few minutes walk down the strip so you could always park at MGM, hit the lion habitat and then head to M&M World for some colorful browsing.",review,eWPFXL1Bmu1ImtIa2Rqliw

This place is so good! The family and I wanted to get a bite to eat before watching Society of Seven at the Riveria Hotel and Casino so we made our merry way to the Food Court since there's a variety to choose from.

Walking up to the food court, you can instantly smell the wonderful spices used in Indian food. I LOVE Indian food so of course I didn't care to check out the other spots, I wanted some curry and naan! 

I ordered the chicken tikka masal, chicken vindaloo and naan. OMG, so freaking good! Both were served with white rice. The naan was like the size of my face! It was coated in butter and I used it to soak up sauce from my dish. The chicken vindaloo was my favorite. It was nice and spicy and had a ton of flavor.  I devoured the whole thing and ate some of the chicken tikka masal since that was my sister's dish. She liked it too. It could have been spicier but that's just personal preference. 

It was kinda expensive but Indian food is kind of expensive as is. Each entrée was $10.99 and the naan was $1.99. The food took a while to come out but it was worth the wait. I got a cup of water and the guy said if I wanted more water he'd fill it up for me. That was nice of him!

I really like this place. When I go back to Vegas, I will for sure come here for my Indian fix. I'm craving Indian food for dinner now!

You know you are my peeps when I let you in on the Silverton. So here we go...here are the reasons why the Seasons Buffet is awesome on a Sunday:
1. Hardly a line....everyone is at the strip which is so not the place to be, and look at me and my girls....3 people ahead of us...we are so close to crabs it's not even funny and I'm not just saying that because we are leaving Vegas.
2. Large round tables! Yes! I hate having to sit at square tables where you can't hear what is going on at the end and you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the ketchup. These tables are huge and me and my girls can get to business which involves sharing photos, memories and mimosas.
3. CRAB! What the hell happened on the strip? I went to the buffet at the Bellagio for Sunday brunch and there was no crab! Are you joking? Whatev...we are at the Silverton, so pile it on. 
4. No rush! The friendly servers at the Silverton want you to sit down and stay awhile. No one pushing you out or frowning when you take obnoxious group photos.
5. When you are done eating you are steps away from the BASS PRO SHOP! Hello? Are we out of mace? It is a long trip home....we may need to check out the tents in case we get stuck somewhere....wait...are those stuffed wildlife? Who doesn't love stuffed wildlife? And the Gun selection! Wow!

For lunch Z Pizza is a decent choice...the times I have been there service is quick and there is plenty of seating to be had. The parking lot is really small and fills up quickly, but don't let that deter you.

The first time I went for lunch I had the pasta with grilled chicken, pinenuts, and basil pesto. For the most part it was a good dish even though the pasta was a tad overcooked. It wasn't an overly large portion, but was the perfect amount for lunch.  I believe the pasta and a drink was close to $10.  I have also had the Moroccan pizza (pesto, feta cheese, pinenuts, and eggplant) which was very tasty although it could have used a bit more feta. For a slice of the Moroccan, a garden salad, and a drink, it was $8.  Some of my coworkers who I dine with also enjoy the calzone (you will have to wait about 10 minutes for it though) and the Santa Fe pizza.

I'm not really a fan of gourmet pizza, but for a lunch spot downtown it is not bad. It's not my first choice but not a place I drag my heels to go to either.

I've had a good experience all around. 

CHILDCARE: (4 year old and 19 month old) IS CRAZY busy. However, after a few weeks I  learned when to go, so the child care isn't so busy. I have found the 8:30 am classes are a safe bet (so the childcare isn't insane) but if you go for a later class in the summer, the place is nuts. I learned they are not state certified, so the state law of 10 children to 1 employee doesn't exist to them... however, they ""try"" to stay close. Once time, It took me 10 minutes just to pick my kids up because the line was so long. 

 Both of my  kids think the place is really fun and look forward to going. It's kept very clean (from what I can see) and the staff is very nice. It is also very safe because you have to badge in with key fob and show picture (which is in the system) to drop off and pick up. The only reason I'm not giving this a 5* review is because the childcare is simply too busy for my taste. 

CLASSES: amazing. The teachers are very nice and friendly. The programs are great. The power yoga is amazing. Muscle classes are great, as well as the TBC classes. Cycle classes are fun. All work up a great sweat and are great. All equipment is kept clean, but some of the hand weights are getting old.

This one in Edinburgh perfectly hits the formula for a full service Marriott: room service, restaurant, bar, executive lounge, etc.

My room (I'm not sure if I was upgraded) was quite nice with a comfortable King-size bed, work desk with chair, two lounge chairs, a large flat screen TV and in the cabinets, a mini-fridge and a coffee/tea service tray. The bathroom was well stocked and good sized with that super curved shower curtain rail I keep meaning to get for my own home.

The room was quiet and clean with little noise from the neighbors or the hallway. I wasn't facing the parking lot (free parking) but the grassy area was host to a colony of at least 10 or 20 of the cutest bunny rabbits that were munching away on who knows what.

Other than the parking and the coffee service, not much else is free here. Some hotels have a ""welcome"" bottle of water waiting. This one did not. Some hotels offer free Internet.

I've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year. Earlier this year, I brought some of my visiting family to the business because the food and service had been so awesome to that point. For some reason, they had a useless cook working that day who burnt everything he sent out to us ... twice. The owner on site was so embarrassed after we showed him what was served, he offered us gift cards to cover our food. My family vowed never to return. I figured it was a fluke and was impressed that the owner acknowledged the problem and did something to address it.

In June, I went in on a Monday and ordered a basket of chicken wings. To my surprise, they were completely out of wings. I ended up going elsewhere to eat that night and sent Stray Cat a private message on their Facebook account letting them know what happened. A month to the day I received a response, ""That was a busy weekend for us. We never want to let a loyal customer down. Hope you'll be back to 'Fix' your wing cravings soon.""

In August, I went in on a Sunday and again ordered a basket of chicken wings. I was stunned because they again were completely out of wings. I sent a followup message to Stray Cat via Facebook letting them know of the pattern and advising they should speak with whomever is doing the product ordering. Their ENTIRE response:

      ""Maybe eat wings on Friday or Saturday when we're fully stocked""

WOW! I immediately went to the bar and requested to speak to the owner who had ironically ""just left"". I gave a printout of the messages sent back and forth to a server who knows me well, told her what happened and asked to have the owner contact me. No contact what so ever.

Our main entrees were OK.  Refills never happened.  After waiting patiently for 30 minutes for our waiter to return, we went and talked to an employee - who was the hostess (hopping around merrily and fraternizing with her friends) while service just went down, down dooooown hill.

Well, we were talking to the hostest saying our waiter was nowhere to be found and she condescendingly says ""he's been helping you!  He's at your table.""  (and he wasn't.)  Then when we walked back to the table I saw her giving my wife a very dirty look.

I'm done with this place.  Agave needs to seriously look at how they're treating their customers.  It is a shame that this restaurant is taking up space in Summerlin when a restaurant that cares to give customer service and EARN their money could be here instead.

Arrived at 8:45pm.  Got our check at 9:55pm.  Be prepared to waste an entire night if you dare venture here.",review,jiQwNP0HovE-NZB-plOWxA

But towards the end of the night, we stopped buying bottles and the girls slowly stopped coming.

So back to my theory, at the beginning of the night they bring out their B strippers (ok looking inexperienced girls). Then once the crowds start coming in, they bust out with their A strippers (young fresh faced veterans).  Then once the crowd has reached max occupancy for the night, they sprinkle in their B strippers and replace a few A strippers with C strippers (cougars, and one trick ponies).

After trying all the clubs I will say that David Barton was just a club for someone who wants privacy, they have few classes and I expect them to be out of business soon, Lifetime is a very nice club but I am shocked that I chose to join LVAC. Although Lifetime is a really big club with well attended classes, when I went to the popular Strictly Strength class at LIfetime there wasn't enough equipment for everyone in class.  After class the people who had brought balls in from another room had to actually wait outside the class to let out to return their equipment.  The teacher was very good and the club was buzzing with activity on a weekend morning. I also saw about 50 kids on the climbing wall and realized that may be hard to get time on as well.  When I attended the Pure Intensity Training class at LVAC (which people LOVE) there must have been between 100-150 people in that class but there was room for everyone and equipment for everyone and we needed steps, mats, bands & 2 pairs of hand weights. I also found the yoga at LVAC to be much better technically and the class size was much smaller and there are more classes to choose from. For $150/month at DBG, $139/month at Lifetime vs. $22/month at LVAC (3 free personal training sessions the first month and one session each month was my 'free upgrade option""). If you are after group fitness classes, LVAC is the best option. If you are looking for more of a country club type atmosphere, have kids that will use the club or want one stop shopping by utilizing their hair salon, Lifetime would be a great choice.  The cafe at Lifetime has a nice sit down area but the choices at LVAC are much better including the fresh squeezed juice & vegetable drinks and the huge menu of protein shakes. I also found the parking at the LVAC (Flamingo & 215) to be no problem & I was closer to the front door and saw security vehicles driving around the lot, where Lifetime was very hard to get a spot without going into the parking structure which for some reason a lot of people just don't want to bother with.

Having some free time on this holiday weekend, it seemed appropriate to stop in and check out the offerings.  Now mind you, I have never been here before today and knew absolutely nothing about this place until walking through the door so there were no preconceived notions what so ever. 

When I arrived, there was but one employee and one customer.  Very spartan digs with some stock items on the right and the counter and kitchen on the left.  The first thing I noticed is the two women were speaking Polish.  Nice! Really? In Litchfield Park?  Knowing Russian (although not using it in too many years) it felt very familiar to me and that was quite nice.  

While waiting for their conversation to conclude, I scanned the place for some of the items on the shelves.  What I found brought me right back to the days of living in Europe back in the 80's.  An enormous assortment of products not seen since my last trip across the pond!  

When the women finished, I was greeted warmly and placed an order for something simple, a chocolate croissant.  Then to my right was a delightful looking apple tart which was screaming for me to take home so I selected that as well.  

We chatted each other up for a few minutes and then I was on my way.  Very friendly place, simple but does what its supposed to do.  High marks so far.  She even offered me a menu to take with me detailing all of their goodies. 

Upon returning home, the croissant was destined for my belly along with a piping cup of fresh coffee.  It was quite delicious and a repeat performance is needed!  

Later tonight, once dinner was completed, we tore into the Apple Tart, the other purchase made this morning. It also was exceptional!!  Memories of being at a cafe in Bavaria relaxing and not wanting to do anything but savor the moment came rushing back to me.  I'm hooked!

A friend and popped into Bill Johnson's for lunch unplanned. We should have planned better. 
Now looking for a lighter fare perhaps we shouldn't have tried a ""cowboy"" establishment, but I was still craving some down home cooking after a disappointing trip to Chilleens on 17 (you can check out my review of them as well if you'd like), so we took a shot. 
Service was friendly enough and they had Kiltlifter on tap; a redeeming grace for any establishment in my humble opinion. My friend tried a smothered chicken breast and I went for the sautéed tilapia since I was wanting something a tad lighter. But I was still craving some good baked beans and a baked potato with the works sounds delicious. My friend went for the green beans and the interesting sounding green chile mac and cheese. 
The food took a while to get there. So long that I was beginning to think the fish was a good choice since clearly they were having to still catch it and kill it. When it arrived I was far from impressed. The sides were lukewarm at best yet the fish was hot; telling me that things sat around waiting for the cook to prepare my fish. I now wish they had found somewhere else to go. 
While my friend's chicken wasn't bad with peppers and onions and cheese, the smothering was hiding a near inedible edge to the breast. Clearly cooked at too hit a temp and ruining the edges of the meat. My fish had received the same treatment. Add over spicing with pepper and some loathsome lemon butter goo, and you get a relatively unpleasant meal.  
The sides were no better. Bland canned baked beans once again and the ""cheese"" sauce was as runny as water in the mac and cheese.

I got the Bandido panini - mostly because I liked the name of the sandwich and couldn't decide what else to get.  It was pretty good!  Lots of turkey, nicely toasted with that little crunch.  Loved the roasted red peppers and sundried tomatoes in it and pepper jack cheese gives its a kick!  For an dollar extra, I got some pasta salad on the side.  I thought that was sort of bland and could use some extra flavor.  Nothing really too fancy there!

My husband got the Wise Guy because he has a love for Italian sandwiches.  It was pretty mediocre.  ""Better than a Subway sandwich"" was what I thought when i bit into it.  There was way too much bread so the meat got a little lost (insert ""thats what she said"" here).

From the creator of the show Brothers & Sisters (which I also loved), this play will make you laugh and maybe make you cry (if you're sensitive like I am)... if nothing else, it will make you reflect on life and family dynamics.  Hopefully, it will make you see that no matter how disfunctional your own family is, there are others out there dealing with their own crazy stuff.

The cast of this show did an amazing job as well... the characters were incredibly believable and real.  My favorite may have been Will Mobley who played the younger brother, Trip Wyeth.

I'd say it's middle of the road for AYCE Korean BBQ.  This is the first AYCE that I'd seen set up buffet style.  They've got a fair selection of meat - marinated beef and chicken, marinated short ribs, spicy pork, rare steak, etc.  They've even got the fatty pork belly that you can put on the grill first to get it going.  Garlic pieces and the onion slices you might get at other Korean BBQs was there, but pretty dry and wilted in the salad bar area.  I didn't check to see if they had the lettuce wraps or soybean paste.

They've got a small sushi buffet area, as well as some Korean sides (3 or 4 different kinds of kimchi and other items), as well as large rice cookers with both the mixed rice (this is a light purple) and white rice.  They also had big crock pots that looked like they had rotating soups.  It was kalbi tang when we were there - like everything else, the soup wasn't anything special, but wasn't bad either.

We were expecting it to be crowded, but it was empty, which was good for us because we were hungry and didn't want to have to wait too long for our food to come out (as I'd experienced other times when the restaurant was busy).  Anyways, we ordered Mini Corn Dogs, 8 Boneless Wings with Asian Zing sauce, and 24 Traditional Wings with half covered in Medium sauce and the other half covered in Asian Zing sauce. Here is a breakdown of the food we ordered:

Mini Corn Dogs- Yummy. The cornbread coating was crunchy yet soft on the inside while the hotdog was hot. The accompanying spicy mustard sauce was good too. My cousin noticed that the recipe changed, saying that the new recipe was better as the cornbread coating was less doughy than before. 

Boneless Wings- More meat than Traditional Wings, but a little more expensive. I enjoyed the crispy coating and the moist white meat inside, but I did find the coating a little too salty.  

Traditional Wings- Mini drumsticks and wings deep-fried to perfection. I found some of the wings to be too fatty, but at least the meat wasn't dried out or tough. I also preferred the drumsticks to the wings because there was more meat to eat. I am in love with the Asian Zing sauce. It's the perfect blend of spicy and sweet, and matches so well with the fried wings. The Medium sauce was too salty in my opinion. 

Celery- Yay for negative calories! I wish some of the celery pieces had been cleaned more thoroughly to remove the hard-to-remove dirt spots. Also, some of the pieces of celery didn't seem fresh as they weren't as crunchy as I like my celery to be. 

Overall, we had an enjoyable time at this Buffalo Wild Wings eating, talking, and watching sports on the big screen TVs. Usually it's too loud to have a decent conversation at Buffalo Wild Wings, but this night proved different.",review,zgCwHvZ7eHDd6A6hkkTcSQ

I was talked into doing this run with a coworker who didn't even end up signing up to do it after I did, so I thought, ""Whatever! I'm still doing it!"" Luckily, another friend of mine who runs all the time decided to do it with me, and so I'm glad were able to go together. 
I really didn't know what to expect. I definitely didn't expect there would be 20-something corrals. My friend signed up that she ran 9 min miles and I signed up that I did 10:30-11 min miles. That placed her in the 5th corral and my time placed me in the 22nd corral. She decided to wait in my corral with me and that forced her to wait a whole hour for my corral to start. The first few corrals were done by the time we started and the corral waiting areas were so packed like sardines. 
It felt great to finally start jogging/running and some of the ""runners"" in the earlier corrals were already walking about 5-10 minutes in, so I was surprised. This just meant there was a bit more weaving involved, but oh well, I was glad to see there were so many people in support of this run.I enjoyed finishing the run in the stadium. I've never been in a run where you end up in a stadium. There's people up on the bleachers and people everywhere on the grass. The support was great in there when you were done! I 
The shirts given this year were really nice. They were almost like that dry fit material instead of just cheap cotton. I showed my brother-in-law the shirt, and he joked and said that he would do the run just for that cool shirt since it is only $35 to enter the run and shirts like that usually cost close to that. 
There were tons of vendors there to explore when done with the race. Our favorite vendor was Chick-Fil-A, because they were handing out free chicken sandiwiches!! Of course, once people found out that they were doing that, people started stalking the Chick-Fil-A truck. The volunteer/workers at Chick-Fil-A had to be more discreet about passing the sandwiches out and take little rolling coolers and sneak around the back of the truck to get to other parts of the crowd. Jamba Juice was dependable as it has been at other runs I've been to, and they had no shortage of free jamba juice!

I asked what happens to the other 1/2 slice of bacon and was actually told it gets saved for the next sandwich!!!  The final frustration was burned hash browns. Not not crispy, burned.

Excellent customer service! My husband, brother-in-law and I went furniture shopping last night. The Room Store was our 4th stop of the evening, and we found the living room set we were looking for right away. Allen, our salesman, approached us and said ""we have that in another color right around the corner"". Little did he know, just then we were discussing purchasing it in a darker color. 

We began looking at the darker version, and he came up and handed me a business card with the full price of the 4 pieces we were looking for, along with delivery and scotch guard, all rolled into it. Within 15 minutes we were at a table purchasing the set from him. Allen was excellent to us and provided us with exactly the information, support, and assistance we needed, right when we needed it. He was able to anticipate our needs and ensure that they were met; he even moved things around in order to accommodate our short timeline for delivery.

The furniture is being delivered in a few days; I'll update my review when we have seen the final delivered product.

This means I don't eat at a restaurant because a celebrity is associated with it, and therefore any feelings I may have - positive or otherwise - in regard to said celebrity, don't mess with my meal. Good food is a serious business.  It should never be adulterated with bile. 

THE FOOD
After consulting with the waiter, I ordered a cocktail... a Cactus Pear Margarita, a Blue Corn Pancake appetizer, and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash.  

The Cactus Pear Margarita (Herradura Silver Tequila, cactus pear syrup and lime juice) had a strong background flavor of grapefruit, which was not to my taste.  The replacement drink was a White Peach Margarita (white peach puree, Herradura Silver Tequila, lime juice).  It was exquisite.  A perfect balance of flavors.  Not too sweet.  Not too sour.  Not excessively fruity.  

Meanwhile I had the bread basket to explore. It included three breads; a jalapeno cornbread muffin, a slice of nutty whole wheat, and a few wedges of light as air foccacia.  Okay... the muffin was actually the highlight of my entire day.  Maybe several days.  Crumbly, salty sweet, just spicy enough to be interesting.  I immediately wanted a dozen more, and my appetizer hadn't even arrived.  Later I sampled the whole wheat - which was somewhat pedestrian after the muffin, and the foccacia - another delicious surprise.  I could have dined on bread alone and gone away full and happy.  But more was to come.  

The Blue Corn Pancake is just that, a blue corn pancake filled with barbecued duck, topped with at least three sauces, including the habanero chile and star anise listed on the menu.  The blend of flavors was powerful, exotic, and extremely rich.  People who cannot or don't care for spicy foods should avoid this dish.  The heat of the smoky sweet barbecued duck was balanced with the mild blue corn, then kicked again into high gear with the sauces.  Wow!

The Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash was... well, interesting.  Topped with a poached egg the combination was relatively mild.  The consistency of the whole dish was soft, almost deceptively so, because the sauces drizzled over the dish were quite spicy. I ate half and brought the rest of it home to Los Angeles to eat later.  It was actually better tasting when I heated it up the next day.  

Since I was taking leftovers home, I went ahead and ordered a dessert.  The waiter and I spent some time talking about what would travel well, eventually settling on the Smoked Vanilla & Toasted Walnut Flan.  Actually, it was a coffee flavored flan with a smoky vanilla caramel top and some candied walnuts on the side. I may sound more blase than I feel, but the description on the dessert menu just did not do it justice.  Even after being hauled onto a plane and stuck in a refrigerator for a day, the flan was creamy, subtly flavored, and absolutely splendid. 

In fact, the whole meal was a five star experience.  It takes a truly superb kitchen to create the effortless complexity of flavor and presentation I got at Mesa.

THE SERVICE
I had my luggage with me when I came into the restaurant and the Greeter immediately offered to put it aside in a private locked closet. Although she didn't give me a claim ticket, she did recognize me when I left.  I did wonder how that all works when the restaurant is particularly busy.

As you can tell already, I take up a waiter's time.  I expect them to be knowledgeable about the menu, familiar with the dishes, and to have an opinion (their favorites).  I did not order the waiter's favorites, but any really good waiter appreciates fine food and WILL have at least one dish on the menu that they rave about.  Great restaurants hire great waiters.  Mesa Grill gets five stars here as well.  Not only did I have a great waiter, I had two, plus a busboy who might as well have been a third, and a personable bartender who brought me my second drink ... AND STOOD THERE waiting to make sure I was happy with it. 

Mind you, I was there at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Monday.  So most people should not expect to get quite this level of attention, but I have no doubt that these guys are steller even at the most hectic of times. I really put them to the test at the end. I asked to have the hash and a couple of those amazing muffins packed along with the flan.  Then I had them repack it so that I could fit it into my carry on bag.  No fuss.  No looks.  Just whatever help I seemed to need.  (many thanks Joel, Dario & Adam!) 

I would write a longer review, but I have run out of room.  Let me just say that the environment was excellent (quiet, light enough to see, but not too bright, and the bathroom was clean), and the bill, including tip was under $75.  For this level of restaurant, that's dirt cheap.",review,DO3Gk17RyJVW7zYMCtYPnw

If you have a choice, DO NOT go to TASC, they just want your money and they think you are nothing but a piece of shit.  Even their head counselors are used to screaming at and demeaning their customers.

As for the room, it was a wonderful treat. Modern, asian motiff, hi-tech and chic. The curtains, temperature and tv are all controlled electronically by the small monitor/clock on the bedside. Oh lala. The linen, is a heavenly refuge: soft and smooth perfect to cradle your weary body. The bathroom is roomy and sexy. Firstly, who does not love the very modern bath tub equipped with bath salt and adorned with rose petals. The tub itself is also nicely located so you can enjoy bathing and watch the small tv affixed on the vanity mirror at the same time. ""Fancy indeed."" Secondly, the rain shower head in the walk in shower is just soothing and lovely. My husband loves them so much he spends 30 minutes there. Thirdly, the separate toilet and sink is a great idea for personal privacy while the modern double sink is elegant. Hoah! the cute jewelry box filled with luxurious and sweet scented amenities. 

Did I mention that they have the so called ""valet cabin."" It is located right by the door and it is where you can drop your shoes for shining, clothes to be dry cleaned and so forth. This is apparently to preserve you privacy and maximize your restful stay.

Furthermore, you must not miss out delighting yourself on the inviting pool deck, poolside cabana and relaxing jacuzzi. All these feels right after a good workout in the fitness room or treatment from the world renowned spa.

The apartments themselves are nice.  Our apartment was very large for a one bedroom and it had a nice open floor plan and high ceilings.  The grounds and pool area was always well maintained.  The location is convenient to downtown, once you walk past a few blocks of sketchiness.  The management was always very friendly and was quick to repair maintenance issues.  And to top it all off the rent was dirt cheap!

So why would I not recommend the Legacy Bungalows?  Well that would be because of our fellow neighbors.  Many of the apartments are rented out as section 8/low income apartments, and it shows.  I should have been tipped off when I was signing my lease and I had to sign several documents saying I would not commit a crime or sell drugs in the apartment complex.  Some of the things I experienced while living there include being awoken at 6 am on a Sunday by someone trying to beat in my neighbors door with a baseball bat screaming, ""I'm going to f-ing kill you b*tch!"", people inside the dumpster rummaging through our trash several times a week, parking my car next to the most dumpy cars I've ever seen in my life, being asked several times if I ""smoked"" and if I wanted to buy some ""weed"", and having my door checked if it was unlocked by people who seem to be checking every door in the complex presumably to break in and steal things.  The door checking thing happens several times a week, making me paranoid that my door be locked at all times.  

Until they stop renting to low income families and the surrounding area cleans up a little, I would avoid living here.",review,CpRO_EC8sbn93UE8Jx7zDw

1. I called Rehab & told them we would be coming in the next night with 13 people at 6 PM & wanted to know if we could make a reservation (since it's a burger joint, I never expected they would say yes).  The woman who answered was very personable, took my name & number & told me they would be ready for us.  My husband & I arrived early because we've heard that so many times before, only to get to the restaurant & still have to wait for our table.  When we arrived at 5:45 PM, the table was waiting for us just as promised.  The woman who promptly & warmly greeted us was gracious & accommodating when we told her our party of 13 grew to 16.

2. The service was OUTSTANDING!  The first time I visit a restaurant it's for the food.   Great service is what brings me back time after time.  Our server & the staff who assisted her were very friendly, helpful & attentive without being over-bearing.  Our food arrived hot & in a timely fashion (not an easy feat when serving a large party on a busy Friday night, & yet they made it seem so easy).  I could tell that it was important to her that we had an enjoyable dining experience.  

3. The management went above & beyond to accommodate our daughter's peanut & tree nut allergy.  When we told our server our daughter had a severe food allergy, she said would like us to talk to an owner to ensure our daughter's safety.  She promptly returned with co-owner, Wiley Arnett.  He told us the only nuts in the kitchen were in the salad prep area.  He informed his kitchen staff about our daughter's allergy & monitored things to make sure that there was no cross-contamination.  He even stopped by to let us know that the kitchen was carefully preparing our appetizers so as not to have any cross-contamination, in case our daughter wanted to eat any of them.  I realize as long as there are nuts in the kitchen there's always a risk of cross-contamination, but we truly felt like every precaution was being made so she could safely eat there.  It was refreshing to be able to dine out without being made to feel that her allergy was an inconvenience.  

4. Ken Likewise, Denise Nelson & Wiley Arnett own Rehab.  We had the pleasure of meeting both Denise & Wiley.  After meeting them & seeing the way they work together & with the staff, it's no wonder everyone who works & dines at Rehab seems so happy.  Denise & Wiley exude hospitality.

5. The food at Rehab Burger Therapy is AWESOME & plentiful!!!  The menu is superb & will surely please any member of your party.  Our party of 16 included meat-lovers, vegans, health fanatics, a diabetic, a peanut & tree nut allergy & some picky eater children.  I can unequivocally say that everyone left the restaurant happy & satisfied.  There are very few restaurants, if any, that I can say that about.  I have been to restaurants that boast something for everyone, but usually at the expense of good taste.  Everything that we ordered was DELICIOUS & tasted FRESH not processed & the portions were very generous.  I was able to sample several of their menu items since our party was so large & with varied palates.   We started with an order of both cheese & also chicken quesadillas.  I didn't have the opportunity to try any because the kids in the group inhaled them the second they were put down on the table.  We had 2 orders of chicken wings, one with Gold Medal Sauce, & the other with Medium Sauce.  These were also a huge hit!  We had 2 orders of their Spa Treated Clams that were so amazing I really wanted the entire 2 orders for myself.  The chili cheese fries appetizer was huge (great for a group), but unfortunately never made its way to my end of the table.  I had a burger, which was absolutely AMAZING!  If you get a burger, I highly recommend getting it on a pretzel bun.  It really is outstanding.  Burgers come with a choice of fries or sweet potatoes, I substituted a salad for the potato choice & it was a meal in itself!  Fortunately, I was able to sample the fries & sweet potatoes off the plates of others in our group.  The Lemon Mermaid Dust that they sprinkle on the fries makes them addicting.  The sweet potatoes are actually sweet potato tots, even if you don't like sweet potatoes you would be missing out if you don't try their tots! The other members of our party told me that the grilled chicken sandwich, Portobello mushroom sandwich & all-beef hotdog were delicious.  We end our meal with a scrumptious brownie dessert that was instantly devoured.",review,v7OwbHgNgy_VQ9eP5FjvUA

While I wasn't totally blown away I would have to disagree with that and I definitely think it's better than mall pizza like Sbarro's.  We paid $28 for four slices (two with sausage and mushroom, one white pizza, and one pepperoni and mushroom pizza) and two bottles of water.

Let me put it this way: I live 2,500 miles away in New York and I make special trips to Las Vegas just to practice and teach occasional workshops here. No joke, I've even entertained the idea of moving here just to be closer to this beautiful studio.

It's a home. A haven. A family. A safe place where everyone's practice is beautiful and validated, because their stellar instructors understand that yoga is not about perfection, it's preparation for life and all its joys and challenges - and sometimes just showing up on your mat is the greatest victory.

But that doesn't mean they won't work you. Push you. Adjust you. Guide and inspire you. These are some of the most skilled yoga instructors I've ever encountered.

Thanks to my work as an international fitness master trainer, I've had the privilege to practice with incredible teachers around the world, from NYC to LA, from Prague to Costa Rica, and there is truly no place like this home. I cry every time I leave, and cry every time I return. 

Karen and Patrice are my personal angels, but I've never taken a less than beautiful class here. And owner Carol is a constant loving presence.

My initial impressions is that its in a nice neighborhood, doesn't feel run down, and the atmosphere was pretty relaxed. Sierra Gold was probably half full, people were having a good time, and some were making out at the bar.. alright! 

The happy hour special is after 12, requires a beer bytes card, and is consisted of half off pizzas and all drinks. Had a large Blue Moon which was in a big mug (maybe 2 bottles?) but had a tiny orange slice. Aw come on now.. the orange is not a decoration it has a real purpose. 

One of my friends ordered his pizza first while me and my other friend decided to think a bit more, it was another 15 minutes before we saw the waitress again, kind of slow.. but understandable I suppose since she was the only waitress taking care of 6 or 7 parties.

So the pizzas were decent, but I'm not expecting something crazy from a bar. It was a thin crust but had many specialty choices like the fajita pizza. I noticed a bit of inconsistency between my fajita pizza and my friend's hunter pizza, his toppings covering almost the pizza to the edge and mine was 2 inches short from the edge. Oh well not a big deal.

HH is Wednesday to Friday 6 p.m. - 9 p.m:
Well drinks: $3
Ketel One and Crown Royal cocktails: $5
Craft beers: $5
Domestic draft beer: $3

Hit the roof (opens at 7pm) and enjoy the weather with a few discounted cocktails! There is no live music/dj at that time, but they pipe in tunes from downstairs, so you can still bop that head should you so choose to do so. If you can snag the couch in the corner, do so, otherwise you might be stuck with your back against a fence (poor). If the roof isn't your thing (or you might melt up there), the downstairs portion of the bar is pretty wide open during these hours. Sure, you're missing out on the main cocktail menu here, so if you want the real experience of this bar, snag one of those drinks and then pay the same amount for 2 Crown's after :)

Before you head in there they ask you to put your cell phones and electronics into a locker...had I know what I know now I would've snuck my camera in...MISTAKE #2.  Once everyone was ready to go inside they run down the rules of this place.  Once you're finally inside...one word...CROWDED and small!! if you hate tight and cold spaces, this is def. not the place for you.  The bartender was probably the best thing in that place he had hooked it up at the bar with an extra shot.  

So after my 2 cocktails were done...I was still waiting to take a group picture for my birthday.  Something to save the memories of coming here.  The camera girl, MARY, came around took our photo but then said that the flash wasn't working properly so she would go and fix it and come back.  10 mins later, MARY, came back in the room but does she come to take our photo? NO! she starts to take photos of people who JUST GOT THERE?!  How are you going to tell a paying customer you will be back and then not do what you said?!  Finally, she came back around to us and once again...FLASH IS OUT?!?! WTF?!?!  MARY, tells us the same BS again, oh it's broken I'll be back.  10 more mins after she comes back once again she does the SAME BS!  I didn't mind that she had to go fix her camera but wtf if you say you're going to come back, then fucking COME BACK.  this time, instead of coming straight to us for our photo, once again...the B goes and takes a photo of another couple who just got in who sat next to us.  MARY, even has the nerve to tell me to GET OUT OF THE WAY! are you F-ing kidding me?! that was the last straw, in my mind MINUS 5 was dead to me.

We complained to the General Manager Marc...DONT BOTHER! it's like speaking to a broken record.  Def. does not know customer service and def. should be retrained in it!!

After being seated, we were greeted by a very rude waitress (Britni) who took our drink order. Five or so minutes later she came back with our waters and took our order. We ordered the California club pizza and also a peach tea. Fifteen minutes rolls by and no sign of our waitress, our glasses of water were empty, haven't got the peach tea yet (starting to get annoyed). The food runner brought out our ""eye candy"" pizza, Man - O - Man it looked delicious. Keep in mind we still haven't got the peach tea yet, with our waitress nowhere to be found I waved down another waitress, who kindly stopped and asked if we needed anything.  Ask her if she could get us a side of ranch and our peach tea we ordered 20 or so minutes ago. She apologized and said she'll be right out with it. Soon after she had left ""OUR"" waitress (Britni) shows up and ask if we needed anything. In my mind I was thinking (OMG are you for reals! Where the hell have you been!). Asked her about our peach tea and asked her for a refill on my water. 

She reply's back ""Oh, I totally forgot about the peach tea"".  No apology what so ever. The peach tea FINALLY came out after we were done with our pizza.To top it off she charged us for the troubled peach tea.

Aside from the horrible waitress the pizza was awesome and full of flavor. 

P.S. If you hate your job that much, please do us all a favor and quit. Go find something else to do with your life.",review,jsblnIZnHUQGufwVb_yX6g

I got what I thought was a great lunch deal....a brisket sandwich with 1 side and a drink for $6.00.

The bread was ick...nothing at all special , the meat was dry and VERY bland with 2 tiny rings of onion and 2 small pickle slices....if it wasent for the average bbq sauce I would have tossed the sandwich and learned where NOT to go for BBQ!

I chose cole slaw as my side which like the brisket was bland and nothing to speak of.  One  of the people in my party had mac and cheese....""can you say boring""?

Althought another person got the ""baked potatoe casserole"" as a side which was actually really good..... in fact I would say it was the best thing I tasted there.

A nice perk is the mini ice cream cone you make yourself.....especially when you put it in a cup and add Root beer!   

Dickeys is the closest BBQ place to me and yet I would rather go without or take a drive to the next closest place.

Food is s personal preference and I am the most PICKEY person I know and the only reason I would go back is to get some more of that potatoe casserole!

I have been slowly picking my way through the Central Phoenix food scene.  While I have found great food in this part of town, this is the first place that a truly surprised me. The meal I just had was a culinary exploration, with subtle details that peaked my interest at every turn. 

First, the bread. A Buckwheat biscuit with vanilla butter.  I mean come on!  Whoever said you should not serve dessert first, was completely wrong.  The sweet vanilla butter took me back and put me in the mood for a great meal.

The sweetbread appetizer.  Okay, while many of you more familiar with Bink's might have expected the Asian influence, I had the pleasure for coming in completely blind.  In this case ignorance was bliss.  The sweet and sour sauce on the appetizer.  Perfection.  Dear Chef, the challenge is on.  You have thrown down the gauntlet and my palate has willingly accepted.
  
Next out, the jicama, the neutral wonder veggie.  Cut perfectly and served an amazing crème fresh and other assorted additions.  Light.  Flavorful. Great Texture.  Damn you Chef, your crazy food brain is taking me for a ride and I am digging what you are putting down.

Fried red potatoes. Is that curry?  Did I just taste curry? And an egg.  Freaking brilliant. 

Okay now for the five spice duck.  I won't describe this for you.  Mainly because I do not command the vocabulary to do so.  All I can recommend is to bring a friend, preferably a lover.  Because frankly the things that you might say while eating this duck, should only be said in front of someone who you are comfortable sleeping with.  

Finally, the Crème Brule.  Chef, as if I had not already been through enough, you serve me this masterpiece.  For those who care to try this dish, the crème brule is great.  The dip n' dot style ice cream with banana and pretzel is great.  But in the middle of the dish is Shangri-La, the convergence, were these two sides meet.  I would explain it more to you, but I think I blacked out.    

So Chef... well done. Well. Done.  And to anyone who reads this, I am sure that you can deduce that this is a must try in Central Phoenix.  I will see you there, likely with my eye rolled into the back of my head.",review,WjtJAtp19nA61b8LT9uLrA

Are we in L.A. or something because the last time I paid $9 for a drink I was on Sunset Blvd.

Last I checked, this is still Phoenix, Arizona. The second time I went my gin and tonic was $7. That was better but got me thinking...Does this place raise the prices whenever they see fit, depending on the crowd and amount of people partying it up? Unless they lowered the price between this weekend and 4 weeks ago, I have a sneaking suspicion they price their drinks according to whatever suits their fancy. I don't like that. In fact, nope..not at all. I'd give this place 5 stars because the actual set up is great but NO ONE SHOULD PAY $9-$12 PER DRINK IN PHOENIX. Period.

We went around 11am on a Saturday. Decent sized menu but not a great selection of dim sum. We just got siu mai, hargow, char siu bao, shrimp w rice noodle, and some mushroom thing - think it was mushroom caps stuffed with pork and baked. 

Most of it was mediocre, but the hargow and shrimp rice noodle may have been made from spoiled shrimp. They were pretty small and had an off sour taste. Both dishes are basically just shrimp and rice noodles so the sour flavor couldn't have been anything but the shrimp. Fingers crossed that none of us get sick. 

The fried rice was pretty good, if a little pricey at $9. It had great curry flavor, not spicy but with a little bit of a kick. The egg was cooked all the way thru so there was no yolk to mix up with the rice, but I still liked it.

We came here last week after church for Easter Sunday around 2-ish for dinner.  We had made our reservations on Open Table/Yelp and our booth was waiting for us when we arrived.  Actually, the WCG was only half full at the time after a busy brunch, but it was nice having the hostess escort us over to our table by the window.

Our water glasses were filled, as we sat looking at our menus.  Heather our server came by giving us the Specials of the day.  The three of us decided to skip the wine list, opting instead for Ice Tea.  It had already been a long day, and any alcohol would have put us to sleep.

We started by sharing the Ahi Tuna Salad for $14.95.  WCG normally sears it with a sesame crust which is very good, but today we asked them not to cook it but serve it raw.  There is something about raw ahi tuna, in their champagne vinaigrette that speaks to me.  Today was no different, it was very nicely done.

For dinner we order, the End Cut Prime Rib for $24.99, the Baby Back Rib for $21.99, and the Balsamic Rib Eye for $26.89.  Each of us had a bite of the others and we were very happy with our selections.  

The Rib Eye was not what you would have expected, in so far as it was not a piece of prime rib without the bone, but instead two small 7' cutlets cooked in a glazed balsamic reduction sauce.  Very nice.   The Baby Backs were as you would expect, as was the End Cut.

For dessert, we ordered the Bread Pudding for $7.59 and the house special Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake also $7.59.  We also had some coffee for $2.49 and a Cappuccino for $2.99.

In my Yelp Tip, I mentioned the Bread Pudding as being exceptional and it is,  I know on some cooking shows, it looks like just day old bread and a cream sauce of some kind.  But at WCG, the sauce is almost Creme Brulle-ish and it really is out of this world.  

The total damage came to $116.00, before tax of $10.79 and tip; which seemed fair for three people.  One of things we like to do is go to a movie at the nearby Harkin's Cine Capri and stop at WCG for dessert afterwards.  We really had a nice time at the WCG on Easter and we will certainly recommend them.

Enjoy!",review,XWvht_1ZLdK7EHJ3jo4q0g

The service is actually offensive. Sometimes a kitschy place with crappy service can be kind of quaint, in an oh-they're-just-stoned way, like Cheba Hut.

Parts of our order went missing, but magically still appeared on the check (once it finally got delivered)... and, as you might imagine, getting that little ditty rectified took another ten minutes. 

The patrons can also be obnoxious, but I realize this is Scottsdale, so one should assume that all places are contaminated with 19-year-olds in the same cheap Forever 21 dresses and pleather hooker heels they had on the night before as well as screechy stay-at-home moms who are deluding themselves that liberal doses of plastic surgery and self-tanner are going to restore their looks to their pre-spawning state. These characters go with the territory, but they are far easier to deal with with MORE THAN ONE CRAPPY CUP OF COFFEE on board.

Quite simply put, I was worried while waiting for my food.  I did not notice when I first walked in that the place was filthy.  Half of the tables were unwashed.  One had a high chair that a baby had been sitting in and it showed.  There was food all over the place. Tables and floors alike.  Another table still had old dried up rice all over it and a wiping rag just sitting there.  Tables don't wipe themselves.  To top it off there was a man working on the beverage fridge.  Thats fine right?  Wrong.  He was crawling up underneath it and using an acetylene torch.  I could smell it every time he sparked it on and I could hear loud pops every time he turned it off.  It was crazy.  This flame in such a small area was getting very close to the 2-liter bottles stored back there.  It was kind of scary.  I thought the place was going to blow up.  It seems inappropriate to be using a torch during dinner hours and so close to the dining room.  

As for the food, I ordered from the Japanese side for a change.  A chicken katsu bento box with white rice, a salad and fried shumai.  The shumai threw me.  I would expect gyoza in a bento box faster than I would shumai.  Don't get me wrong.  The shumai was fine.  Just not what I would expect.  The katsu was superbly crispy.  I with there was more of it.  And more of the sauce would have been nice too.  As for the salad.  The ""ice"" in the iceberg lettuce must have melted because that salad of nothing but iceberg lettuce was floating in a pool of water.  Luckily I did not go in there for a salad so I was not sorely disappointed.  

I don't know if or when I will be back to Chop Chop Wok.  I do like there food more often than not but after what I saw while waiting 20+ minutes for take out, I'm not sure how they have an ""A"" rating.

- Uni Udon - a MUST have if you like uni!!!!!!
- Blue fin tuna sashimi

Items on their regular menu that we had:
- Agedashi tofu: fresh tofu, and served in a whole block
- Sashimi Salad: ridiculously fresh sashimi!
- Yellowtail Carpaccio
- Poached egg with uni and salmon roe
- Steamed foie gras egg custard
- Kobe beef fillet with wasabi: We had to order this with all of the reviews that mentioned it, but it didn't live up to the hype. :( Good but not phenomenal.
- Kurobata Pork Cheek : a MUST ORDER!
- Duck with balsamic soy sauce: very tasty!
- Butter sauteed scallop with soy sauce
- Enoki mushroom wrapped with bacon
- Japanese shishito peppers

I had low expectations, thinking it would be a quick walk-through of various artifacts, but it ended up being much more than that. 

The exhibit goes through chronological order, beginning with the construction of the ship and the description of the different cabin classes. There are recreations of the rooms and certain parts of the ship, like the Grand Staircase and the deck of the ship at night, which is eerily cool! It also highlights various passengers' stories and why they were on the Titanic in the first place. Then, it goes into the departure of the ship, the collision with the iceberg, and the aftermath. 

There are a few videos you can watch, including a Discovery channel recreation of the Titanic's demise and another one about the 2010 recovery efforts. There is also a huge chunk of ice that you can touch, which is meant to show you how cold the iceberg and water were that night. The most interesting artifact was The Big Piece, a large part of the ship that was recovered, preserved and now on display. 

I had a $10 off coupon, but I found an even better deal through Tix 4 Tonight. Each ticket came out to $19.60 each after taxes and fees, and for that price, I felt it was worth it. They have an optional audio tour for an additional $6, but there is plenty to read and look at without it. There is also a small gift shop at the end of the exhibit and an opportunity to buy cheesy cut-and-pasted pictures of yourself in front of the Grand Staircase or The Big Piece.

It took me some time to figure out what I was going to buy... I was QUITE indecisive. I wanted to get the freshest, tastiest looking wrap possible to start my studying day off right! 

On the shelf there werent too many options, but among them there were a couple that looked quite stale and one being out-of-date. I handed it back to the lady at the till, then proceeded to choose. I went for the spicy bean wrap. 

I was crossing my fingers that I'd be able to handle the amount of spice (yaneverknowright?), and opted for this. I remember it being around the region of 2.95. Took it away, and hopped on the bus. When I finally had my first opportunity to take a nice bite I found out the wrap. was. spiceless. 

Now when I say spiceless I mean 1. no spicyness 2. no flavour. I paid 3 pounds for essentially a wrap with black beans in it. No salsa, not much else... oh and they said there was cheese in it. WHAT CHEESE??! SO disappointed.

Here you might easily be transformed into Clint Eastwood, John Wayne or one of their lovely ladies when you arrive for a day of horseback riding through the desert. 

I discovered this ranch while hiking up South Mountain during the Cancer Climb. I noticed stables and a western home-front, went home, looked it up on yelp and realized that this might be a fun little experience to check out. 

When I learned my friend was abandoning the desert for the Big Apple, we started looking into a place to host her farewell party. So a group of us decided to check out Ponderosa Stables so she never forgot her time living among cowboys (or wannabe ones) in the desert. Equipped with cowboy boots and flannel (we have to be in character right?), a group of ten girls arrived at Ponderosa Stables for a horseback ride through the desert followed by a genuine cowboy cookout. For those of you who haven't been to this part of South Mountain yet, I suggest checking it out because it's much prettier then you would expect. Each of us were paired with a horse comparable to our size and weight. I had a sturdy and veteran white horse that looked like he was straight out of a movie. 

The horses were calm and friendly and for someone who doesn't ride a horse very often, the staff made it seamless and enjoyable. We went on an hour ride through the desert as the sun glistened on the horizon. It was a completely calm and fun experience as we reminisced with my friend and bid her farewell. The path is natural and true desert terrain on the base on South Mountain. It really reminded how beautiful the desert is. After we brought out the inner cowgirl in us and worked up an appetite while doing so, we arrived back to the stables where our cookout awaited us.

My time at Ponderosa Stables was exactly what I hoped it would be as I walked by it during the Cancer Climb. I learned that they also offer a steak ride where you horseback ride over South Mountain to a local steakhouse, enjoy a steak dinner and ride back. It's on my list to try!

This place is excellent! The first obvious reason is that there isn't any other boba/asian snacks/drinks places around the Centennial area (that I know of, I'm still pretty new to LV) so it's very convenient...

BUUUUT here are the reasons why you should get there and return again and again: 
1. super friendly service! very nice young gentlemen were running the front when I stopped by. Both very helpful and made small talk with me while I was waiting for my order.
2. made-to-order food/drink (sort of). If you want a smoothie, you can actually mix flavors together! I got a Taro and Red Bean smoothie (these are usually separately flavored drinks) to satisfy my love of both delights. The best part is, if you don't like your drink (you want it sweeter, less sweet, didn't like the flavor at all, etc.) they will fix it for you or replace it with something else!
3. Tastes great! My drink (for being a combination of two different drinks) came out perfect, and my popcorn chicken was not bad. 

The only complaint is that some of the chicken pieces had a bit more fat on it than I'm used to. I'm excited to return to try some other smoothie and milk tea flavors I was eyeing, and also their ramen. Hooray for Tea Time Cafe!

See, I lived in Belgium for a year and I miss everything about Belgium terribly (except the weather). The thought that there could be a little piece of Belgium in Phoenix...well, to say the least ,it got me a little excited. That being said, my expectations going in were high.

My first Trente-Cinq experience only ended up being dessert and coffee. I had the mousse au chocolat. Mon dieu! It made me weak in the knees. I savored every little bite, making the mousse last as long as I possibly could. My friend had the cafe liegeois. It was also good, but nothing compared to my mousse.

The next time I went with my family to expose them to Belgian cuisine. I ate the waterzooi, a traditional Flemish dish. It did not disappoint in all its creamy deliciousness. My dad had the lamb shank. He said the meat just fell off the bone. Thumbs up! My brother opted for the boulettes (mini meatballs) and was underwhelmed. We also ordered a salad (I forget which one) that did not impress. Overall, the fam gave the resto a mixed review.

To be honest, I wish Trente-Cinq was something other than what it is. The dining area is simple and feels like it is trying to fit in with downtown Phoenix trendy. I suppose I wanted it to be more like a Belgian eatery would be- more cozy, more traditional, more intimate. Really, maybe I wanted it to be more like the Belgium I experienced as an underpaid au pair who did not see the more upscale side of life. To be fair, there are some things Trente-Cinq really gets right...like that mousse! As for a piece of ""my"" Belgium in Phoenix...it's still only in my head.",review,sclC_o1Ox5BjNupjaRTrBQ

It was sitting in a pool of grease. Barf. I pretty much stuck with the baguette station, I liked the blu cheese and fig and the pecorino and honey comb, oh an the banana nutella crepe.

This place looks like a miracle of architecture and willingness. Every single stone had to be posed challenging the volcanic rocks rising everywhere. Sometimes it is almost impossible to see where the nature of the place ends and the buildings start.

It's by far smaller than other castles I've visited in the last years, but its witchery is by no means less than the castles of Prague or Budapest, to name a couple of largest ""brothers"".

Of course I've only heard that Wildfire had good burgers so I may have been going on bad info for all I know. Anyhow, so I go in here and make my way to the back cafe.

Good...
Friendly service! I have to actually give the server props. I was in a FOUL mood and not being very friendly. Not outright mean or anything, but I was super stressed. She was so nice and even hurried my food since she could tell that I was waiting to get somewhere. I tipped 30% to try to thank her for that!

Cheap...Seriously, a burger and fries for $6. That's pretty cheap especially since you aren't at a fast food place. Definitely worth going back to try other things and see if I just ordered the wrong thing.

Smoke free....or at least I didn't smell any smoke and I am SENSITIVE. Usually you go in casinos and they reek of cigarettes, but this place didn't seem to have  a problem. I don't even remember seeing anyone smoke but I'm sure they do. Ick.

Bad...
Bad seating for singles...I really hate sitting at a table by myself. That's why I usually go to bars. There is a bar in the cafe but there are no chairs around it and it isn't stocked. The servers go to the casino bar to get drinks. I'm sure they just didn't have a call for it, but it still sucks. Here I was sitting in a big booth that could have fit four plus purses. 

Mediocre food...The burger was just ok. Pretty sure the meat was from frozen and the fries were DEFINITELY frozen. I guess I'm spoiled from being in Denver where the restaurants practically compete to have the ""Most Awesome Anything."" The corporate mindset of Las Vegas definitely leaves something to be desired.

Lots of old people...this place seems like it must be the local eatery for all the old people in the area. Everyone seem pretty dated. It makes someone like me who is only in their 30's think that I don't really want to go back again. 

All in all this place was ok and I may try it again one day. I have hope that there might be some better things on their menu if they are taking time to brew beer.

I also tried the Kir Royale (raspberry cake with champagne flavored frosting). Super dry. Not moist at all. And the cake itself is so small. You pay $4.00 for these cupcakes, you'd better give me something with substance. I feel like I got cheated out of a lot with that price.

The menu is a nice variety of Greek and Chicago fast food such as Gyros, Falafel, Vienna dogs, Beefs, and other goodies.  All is prepared at the time you order so it is fresh.

The falafel is great.  It was nice and crispy on the outside and tender inside with perfect spice.  Coupled with home made hummus, fresh salad veggies, and a warm pita this was fantastic.  Unfortunately that was the highlight as the gyro was very disappointing.  Even though it was only 6 pm the burners that surround the Gyro meat had been turned off.  Good gyro meat has a little browning on the outside and is very juicy underneath.  Because the burners weren't on the meat had no browning and instead of being juicy there was the mouth feel of fat as it is beginning to turn solid.  This could have been resolved, to some extent, by warming the meat on the griddle, but they didn't do that.  They DID warm the pitas up...but not the meat.  Kind of strange.

But since it was my birthday, my friend took me here for dinner...and when someone offers to take you out for your birthday, who says, ""hell no, I'm not eating that!""  So I went.

Let me start with the ambiance of the place. The restaurant is actually a house, it looked very homey. We opted to sit outside in front because it was late evening and we saw they had misters...plus, the decorations outside looked so romantic and sweet. Definitely a good choice for a first date! Or ...the 100th date. 

Now on to the food.  He ordered for us but I got to choose the dessert, and yes, I asked for it to come out FIRST.  It was a crepe filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit.  At first I said, ""damn, $12 for a crepe?"" Man, that was amazing.  And well worth more than $12.

We got two pizzas, they were about 8 inches around and it can probably feed a party of 2 (but since we had a huge crepe before, we had to take some pizza togo). My pizza had prosciutto topped with fresh, organic arugula. The crust was thin and very tasteful. I couldn't get enough of it. His pizza had salami, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. Also quite delectable.  Our waiter was very nice, he knew we were talkers so he left us alone to do so. After we were done eating, we wanted to get some coffee but it was 10:30pm on a Sunday night and no one was opened.  Again, our waiter came to the rescue and told us about a local coffee house down the street, about 5 minutes away.  We went there and it was amazing too!....but that's a different review.  :)

To say that I recommend Cibo would not express how I really feel about my experience there.  Let's just say, since that day, I've had dreams about my prosciutto topped with arugula pizza EVERY NIGHT!",review,V1nEpIRmEa1768oj_tuxeQ

However, I was not at all impressed with how management handles their restaurant. Our server was amazing, but everybody else we dealt with today was rude/aloof (possibly racist?:-( ). If I'm paying premium prices for fish and chips, I expect friendly service from ALL staff and management. Instead of accommodating a large birthday party (of which they were aware would be present well in advance), we were placed in awkward seating arrangements and scolded by management for moving tables to allow more people to sit together. No suggestions or accommodations were offered, we had to advocate for different seating that would be more suitable for our needs in an *empty* restaurant. If the restaurant had been even remotely busy, I could understand why this might be an issue, but the place was practically deserted. What makes me use the ""R"" word is the fact that another party who had booked in advance had what seemed like very different treatment. Overall the feeling I have about The Yard can be summed up in one word: icky. I get a pit in my stomach thinking about my experience there.  

I expected much, much more from a Fox concept, having been to many of their other restaurants including the sadly defunct Bloom in the Phoenix area. The Yard is not a place I would go back to of my own volition. Dial down the self-importance, align the overall quality of your service to the prices on your menu, and treat all your customers equally.

Also, they removed the student discount for orders under $10.

Here's what really annoys me though: they have ZERO impetus to improve or provide a decent product in any way, shape, or form.  Students will go there.  Students will buy their terrible food and drink their disgusting coffee.  They can take away the discount, and students will still go there because it's the easiest option.  They will continue to make money off of the customers that will flock there from the medical school next door.  Coffee and a place to study is all any medical student really needs.  Next, to be fair, provides these.  In the same way that an old banana peel and tissue paper could provide food and shelter.  They have their market cornered and can happily drop the quality of product since, no matter what, stressed and under caffeinated students will show up.

As far as being Paleo friendly, I don't think you can get much better than fresh fish, kelp, and some white rice. Skip the soy sauce (contains gluten!) and the mayo-based sauces and you're golden.

It's expensive, like all other sushi restaurants, and I'm skeptical of the quality of their fish for that price like I am with all other sushi restaurants, but given that it tastes so good I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. 

The only real problem I have is that given the price of the all-you-can-eat, I feel like I have to eat at least 3 rolls to break even so I always leave there feeling like I've eaten way more than I should! 


(To clarify, I prefer wild-caught fish over farmed fish, but they make no mention on the menu or anywhere else about the sourcing of their fishes, and when I asked the waitresses didn't know. Wild-caught fish would be worth the price and I wouldn't call them too expensive. Farmed fish is not worth the price, and if that's what they use then they're too expensive.)",review,AeKTQBtPRDHLAFL9bzbUnA

A perfect place to eat alone or with family and friends. 

The menu itself is small, with new menu items displayed on the walls.

I ordered one of the new menu items: the Fried Shrimp Wontons (10 for $4.95)- Large pieces of shrimp only lovingly wrapped in delicate wonton wrappers, and then deep fried to crunchy perfection. Served with a sweet & sour sauce. Delicious! I would order this again!

I also tried some of the Chicken Curry and Roti, which was yummy. The curry was spicy and full of hearty potatoes and quality chicken. The roti was both crispy and chewy, and was the perfect dipping tool for the curry.

All I had to do was look at the expression on my daughter's face as she ran from aquarium to aquarium yelling ""Daddy, do you see that?!"" to know that it was worth the trip. The best part of the exhibit was the large tank at the end with a viewing tunnel going through it.  This gives you almost 360 degree views of everything from sharks to rays to jellyfish.  
Word to the wise, though, if you're planning on making a trip to this place, maybe call ahead and see if their are any field trips planned for the day.  We showed up at about the same time as 10 school buses did, and spent most of the day dodging 200 running, screaming elementary school kids.

They have some glassware as well, and some of it is really expensive...I saw a wine decanter for like $125!!  yikes.

Its a wonderfully relaxed enviroment, and its someplace you can go by yourself too, take a date, or just meet up with people for wine or beer.  clean, nice etc.  Its a wonderfully relaxing place to spend any evening.

The down side?  Don't bother eating here.  Stick to the wine when going.  Food here, I think, is okay, and overpriced.  Its a wine bar, not a resturant.  Also, I think they lack variety in things other then wines, like glassware which you can get at Ikea or Walmart anyways.

Glow sticks, sunglasses, whistles, beautiful people and really loud music. It was the place to be and be seen Saturday. Me? I came for the food. Completely unimpressed. 

Lemon-Ricotta Waffles- They had a very sour taste that could have come from the cheese/yogurt or the lemons. It certainly was off and everyone at the table agreed. 

Pancakes with a Fruit Compote- The consistency of the flapjack was light, fluffy, yet tasteless. The fruit was dull and lacked sweetness. 

Brick oven Margherita Pizza- This was the saving grace. 2 feet long and packed with warmth from the herbs and lightly sauced and cheesed. We devoured it. 

Crispy Garlic Fries- It was the perfect fry. The only item besides the pizza we enjoyed. 

It's too loud to eat let alone have a conversation. The energy and crowd was that of a Vegas nightclub at 2am. Girls in short dresses dancing on tables and guys in sunglasses and chucks standing against the walls. FYI- ladies watch your purse. In fact, bring a clutch.

First of all, I find the whole ""velvet rope"" thing incredibly tacky, pretentious, childish, etc.  It's one thing to be ""at capacity"" and another entirely to treat potential customers as if they were in a cattle call.  One member of our group, a male, was let in immediately because he knew the door man.  The rest of us stood in line for 30-some minutes. Setting aside how very rude it was for that ""friend"" of the birthday girl to ditch her like that rather than insisting she be admitted with him, it was clear that the door man was lying through his teeth about the place being full.  When I called him on it, he said, ""I can only let girls in now--we have too many guys inside.""  Wait, what?
It was not as if we were dressed inappropriately for a night club--we'd just come the rooftop at the W, for pete's sake (another place I've no intention of frequenting by choice)  To add insult to injury, my boyfriend and I were DYING to go to use a restroom.  Of course, two minutes after we stepped out of line to see if we could find one, the rest of our group got in.  No way in hell was I going to stand in that line all over again, but the dick at the door couldn't have cared less.  Luckily, the folks waiting at the front (who had been behind us earlier) took pity and let us get in front of them. Eventually the door guy got tired of hearing me say, ""Look, you already let our party in"" and let us in.
Once inside, I thought, ""Jesus, what do all of these people see in this place?""  Whoever designed the space has clearly confused gaudy for classy--ironically--given the name of the joint, everything looked really cheap, and the employees' dress didn't match the image I believe the Mint aspires to.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that we had to pay ten bucks just to get in.  And after all of that crap, we had to leave five minutes later because one of our friends felt ill. (No wonder)

I've tried a variety of dishes like the Crispy Pata, Adobo, Caldereta, Menudo, Pancit, Chicken Inasal, etc.  They have Karaoke on Friday nights and a small three piece band plays on the weekend. They tried to get me to sing Karaoke but it takes more than a couple of bottles of liquid courage to get me singing.

My favorite dish is the Menudo. This is made with pork, carrots and potatoes served in a sauce. This dish has a similar look to the American Beef Stew dish. In addition, they serve this meal with rice and Pancit Bihon. The best way to eat this dish is to dump the menudo on top of the rice. I always say ""Masarap, Busog na ako"" after eating this meal. Did I mentioned that they give you plenty of food? They give you more rice if you run out of it, but I have never had that problem.

They also run a bakeshop that has all of the traditional Filipino sweets. My asawa especially enjoys the Halo Halo. And she always loads up on the sweets to take home for future consumption.

2. Jumbo fried shrimp dinner w/fries and coleslaw
3. any 6 inch sub and fries, we tried the Italian which came with a yummy Italian dressing! Mmmmm yum!

Three lunch specials at $5x3 plus two drinks our total was change short of a $20!

The pizza was good, a nice sweet sauce, fresh, cheesy and the crust was chewy and good.

The Italian sub was great, good flavor.

The chefs are putting together some top-notch dishes and it's a friendly atmosphere.
I stuck with tapas for our late lunch today, and it was a wise choice. I'm a fan of tapas and I'll always be happy with snacking on plantains and croquetas. This is a great place to do it. We had the ham croquetas, the empanada and the corn fritters (fried food heaven!). For two people it was a nice, light lunch. What's that? Fried food as a light lunch? How absurd! But believe me, even though all three items (among many others on the tapas menu) are indeed fried, you barely notice. Even with the rich bernaise sauce on the croquetas, it still seems light.
The corn fritters have a wonderful blend of corn batter that's just sweet enough without you really noticing it, and the sauce that accompanies lends a nice touch of sourness to balance the act. The center of each fritter is a perfectly smooth and creamy.
The empanada is filled with tasty pork, and unlike many other cuban places I've been too, it was not the least bit dry. The sweet mango sauce that's lightly drizzled over it combines well with the salsa to create some unique flavors.
All in all, it was a very pleasant experience. The chefs are friendly and came out to chat with us and check on our meal. The prices were more than reasonable. Keep in mind they aren't open for dinner on Sundays and they are closed all day Monday. If you get a chance, check it out.

My dad was visiting for his birthday, and being from Wisconsin, we both love the water, so without easy access to another lake (read: no boat), I decided to take him on a relaxing desert cruise.  The captain was very informative and answered everyone's questions, including what kinds of fish were in the lake.  The views were gorgeous, especially at the end when you can see the Four Peaks shimmering in the distance.  We saw a few hawks and eagles, learned about the local vegetation (including a really cool clubbed saguaro), found out when the fishing season was and enjoyed some great local beers (Four Peaks) on the boat.  The inside of the boat is climate controlled, the front gets filled up very quickly, and while the top deck is well-shaded, the end seats can get pretty hot in the warmer months.  The breeze was lovely and all of the staff were attentive and friendly.  

Granted, it's not the most scenic or exciting thing in the world, but if you appreciate local tidbits, a calm atmosphere, and spending time on the water, you might want to check it out.

Bisque is A-OK.  It's totally fine.  The staff are actually quite nice with a cheeky edge which is great, the drinks are completely fine if maybe a bit on the expensive side, and the ambiance... well it's reasonably beige but it's completely fine.

I hear that this used to be an old man's pub.  I really like old man's pubs.  Sure trendy places are good too, but I think ambiance tends to suffer when a place is neither quaint nor trendy... it just becomes... well as I said, beige.

The biggest factor is convenience, since it is very close to work.  They also have a $6.95 special for two slices of cheese pizza and a salad.  

Pizza here is good, but doesn't stand out as anything exceptional.  Pizza is just a bit thicker than what I would call a New York Style, and the crust is thick and crunchy.  The salad is quite a generous portion, enough so that sometimes I'll be eating it until I finish my pizza even though it is brought out first.  You have your greens, onions, tomato, croutons and dressing of your choice.

So with the price point and big salad you get for the $6.95 deal, Delucia's falls short of getting another star because of the service.  There are good days where I can be in and out in 30 minutes.  Other times, it will take 25 minutes for our drinks and salad to be brought out.  Pizza wait time is hit or miss as well, since I've had it come out with the salad or when I was finishing up my salad.

Incident #1

There was this lady in street clothes, probably the manager, at the counter. We walked up looking at the menus high up and we heard ""How are you?"" out loud. So, I said ""oh, how are you?"" She replied "" Oh, I was talking to them."" pointing at the ladies by the front doors.

Incident #2

I was getting some cream for my Iced coffee and there was no half and half left. As I was shaking the pitcher of 1/2 and 1/2, a female worker was stocking napkins right next to me. She looked at me and I looked at her, and I shake the next pitcher, empty as well. She just kept doing her thing and looking at me without a word or an acknowledgment.

Um, I may have been back here 20 (or 30) times since then. 

They always start you off with free (and yummy) papadum with mint and tamarind sauces. Their mango lassis are soooo good and the lychee lassi that my husband randomly tried one day was pretty tasty as well. 

I'm boring and always order the same thing: saag paneer. Theirs never disappoints, however. And you get lots of paneer which makes me extra happy. We've also had the korma and saffron cauliflower and they are both great as well. I have dreams of the garlic naan. 

I would say that the samosas are not so great, and if I was rating this by the buffet only (and the vegetarian food only), I would probably give it 3-stars. Maybe non-veg have a better experience at the buffet, but I'm not sure. 

We wanted to try a new Indian place one Sunday afternoon, but got fed up because they are all closed between the hours of 2-5. So we finally decided to go to our old staple, Mint, for the buffet. We had to laugh because the place was jam packed with Indian customers... we said that all the other restaurants must close to come eat at Mint for a late lunch. 

Most days the food is amazing and occasionally it's just good. Some days the ""medium"" spiciness is too mild and sometimes its too hot. But we've never had a bad experience here and the staff are wonderful and very friendly. Definitely give it a try, and seriously... order a mango lassi.

The good:
-The rooms are pretty technologically savvy.  There's an iPad-like thing located on the nightstand that controls basically everything.  You can close the blinds, control the TV, and even ""refresh"" the room (which also puffs some smelly-goods into the bathroom!) without even leaving your bed!
-The bell-people are friendly and quick.  We had no problem getting our stuff to our room and then back to our car when we left.

The not so good:
-The north valet guys are RUDE.  They don't direct you to where they want you to park, but then honk someone's horn when you park in the wrong spot.
-The mini fridge is completely unusable.  If you pick up an item for more than 30 seconds, you're automatically charged.  The person checking us in didn't bother to inform us, but fortunately I heard the person next to us being told, so we had no issues.  The fridge is also stuffed to the gills, so don't bother putting your own stuff in it.
-The towels are HARD.  I prefer to exfoliate with face wash, but this was a double whammy.  At least my face was nice and smooth after a double exfoliation.
-No free water bottles in the room.  Sorry, but I'm paying $25 a day in resort fees.  I think a bottle of water would be nice.
-I frequently heard the neighbors talking at 2 a.m.  The walls should be a bit thicker.  I can understand hearing someone scream, but regular talking?
-The valet people just aren't as nice as I expect.  Offer me directions, it means a lot even if I don't need them.

Here's the deal:  If I'm paying $200 a night for a room, I expect a certain level of service and I just didn't get it here.  There was nothing WRONG with the hotel room, but the service just wasn't up to par.  Comparing to the Aria's sister hotel next door, Vdara, the Aria just didn't live up to my expectations.  The Vdara is cheaper, quieter, and smells nicer, due to it being a non-smoking, non-gaming property.  They offer two free bottles of water a day in the rooms and also offer directions every time we retrieve our car from valet.  In the future, I'll stay at Vdara.",review,JpHE7yhMS5ehA9e8WG_ETg

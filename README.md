## Data Mining Specialization
### About this Specialization


The Data Mining Specialization teaches data mining techniques for both structured data which conform to a clearly defined schema, and unstructured data which exist in the form of natural language text. Specific course topics include pattern discovery, clustering, text retrieval, text mining and analytics, and data visualization. The Capstone project task is to solve real-world data mining challenges using a restaurant review data set from Yelp.

Courses 2 - 5 of this Specialization form the lecture component of courses in the online Master of Computer Science Degree in Data Science. You can apply to the degree program either before or after you begin the Specialization.
